<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Owing to the different conditions of time, language, country,
and race under which the various books of the Holy Scriptures
were written, it is impossible that they should be rightly understood
at the present day without some study of the customs and
manners of Eastern peoples, as well as of the countries in which
they lived.</p>

<p>The Oriental character of the scriptural writings causes them to
abound with metaphors and symbols taken from the common life
of the time.</p>

<p>They contain allusions to the trees, flowers, and herbage, the
creeping things of the earth, the fishes of the sea, the birds of
the air, and the beasts which abode with man or dwelt in the
deserts and forests.</p>

<p>Unless, therefore, we understand these writings as those understood
them for whom they were written, it is evident that we shall
misinterpret instead of rightly comprehending them.</p>

<p>The field which is laid open to us is so large that only one department
of Natural History&mdash;namely, Zoology&mdash;can be treated in
this work, although it is illustrated by many references to other
branches of Natural History, to the physical geography of Palestine,
Egypt, and Syria, the race-character of the inhabitants, and
historical parallels.</p>

<p>The importance of understanding the nature, habits, and uses of
the animals which are constantly mentioned in the Bible, cannot be
overrated as a means of elucidating the Scriptures, and without
this knowledge we shall not only miss the point of innumerable
passages of the Old and New Testaments, but the words of our
Lord Himself will often be totally misinterpreted, or at least lose
part of their significance.</p>

<p>The object of the present work is therefore, to take in its proper
succession, every creature whose name is given in the Scriptures,
and to supply so much of its history as will enable the reader to
understand all the passages in which it is mentioned.</p>

<h2>THE AUTHOR.</h2>


<p>The Rev. J. G. Wood is a native of London, England. He was
educated at Oxford University, and has long been known, both in
England and America, as not only a learned and accurate writer
on Natural History, but a popular one as well, having the happy
faculty of making the results of scientific study and painstaking
observation, interesting and instructive to all classes of readers.</p>

<p>He has published a number of works on the most familiar
departments of the history of animals, designed to awaken popular
interest in the study. Their titles are "Sketches and Anecdotes
of Animal Life;" "Common Objects of the Seashore and Country;"
"My Feathered Friends;" "Homes Without Hands"&mdash;being
a description of the habitations of animals,&mdash;and the
"Illustrated Natural History," a book which is widely known
both in England and America as a standard work of great value.
It has given the author celebrity, and has caused him to be considered
an eminent authority on the subject which it treats.</p>

<p>It is evident, from these facts, that it would be difficult to find
a man better qualified than Mr. Wood, to write a book describing
the animals mentioned in the Bible.</p>

<p>Profoundly impressed with the ignorance which prevails towards
so important a feature of the Scriptural Narrative, he has devoted
his ripe powers and special knowledge to the work of dissipating
it, and in this volume, not only fully describes the nature and
habits of all the animals mentioned in the Scriptures, but tells the
story of their relations to mankind.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood is a clergyman of the Church of England, and was
for a time connected with Christ Church, Oxford. He has devoted
himself mainly, however, to authorship in the field which he has
chosen, and in which he has become so well known. In his works
he usually employs a popular style of writing, and does not make
scientific terms prominent. This is especially true of the "Story
of the Bible Animals," which from its easy and interesting character
is adapted to the comprehension of young and old.</p>

<p>Many of the pictures in this
book are taken from the living
animals, or from photographs
and sketches by Eastern travellers.</p>

<p>Others represent imaginary
scenes, or ancient historical
events, and have been designed
by skilful artists after careful study of the subjects.</p>

<h2>STORY OF THE BIBLE ANIMALS.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE LION.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Frequent mention of the Lion in the Scriptures&mdash;The Lion employed as an emblem
in the Bible&mdash;Similarity of the African and Asiatic species&mdash;The chief characteristics
of the Lion&mdash;its strength, activity, and mode of seizing its prey&mdash;The
Lion hunt.</p></blockquote>


<p>Of all the undomesticated animals of Palestine, none is mentioned
so frequently as the <span class="smcap">Lion</span>. This may appear the more
remarkable, because for many years the Lion has been extinct
in Palestine. The leopard, the wolf, the jackal, and the hyæna,
still retain their place in the land, although their numbers are
comparatively few; but the Lion has vanished completely out of
the land. The reason for this disappearance is twofold, first,
the thicker population; and second, the introduction of
firearms.</p>

<p>No animal is less tolerant of human society than the Lion. In
the first place, it dreads the very face of man, and as a rule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
whenever it sees a man will slink away and hide itself. There
are, of course, exceptional cases to this rule. Sometimes a Lion
becomes so old and stiff, his teeth are so worn, and his endurance
so slight, that he is unable to chase his usual prey, and is
obliged to seek for other means of subsistence. In an unpopulated
district, he would simply be starved to death, but when
his lot is cast in the neighbourhood of human beings, he is perforce
obliged to become a "man-eater." Even in that case, a
Lion will seldom attack a man, unless he should be able to do so
unseen, but will hang about the villages, pouncing on the women
as they come to the wells for water, or upon the little children
as they stray from their parents, and continually shifting his
quarters lest he should be assailed during his sleep. The Lion
requires a very large tract of country for his maintenance, and
the consequence is, that in proportion as the land is populated
does the number of Lions decrease.</p>

<p>Firearms are the special dread of the Lion. In the first place,
the Lion, like all wild beasts, cannot endure fire, and the flash of
the gun terrifies him greatly. Then, there is the report, surpassing
even his roar in resonance; and lastly, there is the unseen
bullet, which seldom kills him at once, but mostly drives him to
furious anger by the pain of his wound, yet which he does not
dread nearly so much as the harmless flash and report. There is
another cause of the Lion's banishment from the Holy Land.
It is well known that to attract any wild beast or bird to some
definite spot, all that is required is to provide them with a suitable
and undisturbed home, and a certainty of food. Consequently,
the surest method of driving them away is to deprive
them of both these essentials. Then the Lion used to live in
forests, which formerly stretched over large tracts of ground, but
which have long since been cut down, thus depriving the Lion of
its home, while the thick population and the general use of firearms
have deprived him of his food. In fact, the Lion has been
driven out of Palestine, just as the wolf has been extirpated
from England.</p>

<p>But, in the olden times, Lions must have been very plentiful.
There is scarcely a book in the Bible, whether of the Old or
New Testaments, whether historical or prophetical, that does not
contain some mention of this terrible animal; sometimes describing
the actions of individual Lions, but mostly using the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
word as an emblem of strength and force, whether used for a
good purpose or abused for a bad one.</p>

</div>

<p>There are several varieties of Lion, which may be reduced to
two, namely, the African and the Asiatic Lion. It is almost
certain, however, that these animals really are one and the same
species, and that the trifling differences which exist between an
African and an Asiatic Lion, are not sufficient to justify a
naturalist in considering them to be distinct species. The habits
of both are identical, modified, as is sure to be the case, by the
difference of locality; but then, such variations in habit are continually
seen in animals confessedly of the same species, which
happen to be placed in different conditions of climate and
locality.</p>

<p>That it was once exceedingly plentiful in Palestine is evident,
from a very cursory knowledge of the Holy Scriptures. It is
every where mentioned as a well-known animal, equally familiar
and dreaded. When the disobedient prophet was killed by the
Lion near Bethel, the fact seemed not to have caused any surprise
in the neighbourhood. When the people came out to
rescue the body of the prophet, they wondered much because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Lion was standing by the fallen man, but had not torn him, and
had left the ass unhurt. But that a Lion should have killed a
man seems to have been an event which was not sufficiently
rare to be surprising.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to those characteristics of the Lion
which bear especial reference to the Scriptures.</p>

<p>In the first place, size for size, the Lion is one of the strongest
of beasts.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="tiger" id="tiger"></a>
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="450" height="378" alt="tiger" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">LION AND TIGER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, the strength of the Lion is equally distributed over the
body and limbs, giving to the animal an easy grace of movement
which is rare except with such a structure. A full-grown Lion
cannot only knock down and kill, but can carry away in its
mouth, an ordinary ox; and one of these terrible animals has been
known to pick up a heifer in its mouth, and to leap over a wide
ditch still carrying its burden. Another Lion carried a two-year
old heifer, and was chased for five hours by mounted farmers, so
that it must have traversed a very considerable distance. Yet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the whole of this long journey, the legs of the heifer had only
two or three times touched the ground.</p>

<p>It kills man, and comparatively small animals, such as deer
and antelopes, with a blow of its terrible paw; and often needs
to give no second blow to cause the death of its victim. The
sharp talons are not needed to cause death, for the weight of the
blow is sufficient for that purpose.</p>

<p>When the hunter pursues it with dogs, after the usual fashion,
there is often a great slaughter among them, especially among
those that are inexperienced in the chase of the Lion. Urged by
their instinctive antipathy, the dogs rush forward to the spot
where the Lion awaits them, and old hounds bay at him from a
safe distance, while the young and inexperienced among them
are apt to convert the sham attack into a real one. Their valour
meets with a poor reward, for a few blows from the Lion's terrible
paws send his assailants flying in all directions, their bodies
streaming with blood, and in most cases a fatal damage inflicted,
while more than one unfortunate dog lies fairly crushed by the
weight of a paw laid with apparent carelessness upon its body.
There is before me a Lion's skin, a spoil of one of these animals
shot by the celebrated sportsman, Gordon Cumming. Although
the skin lies flat upon the floor, and the paws are nothing but
the skin and talons, the weight of each paw is very considerable,
and always surprises those who hear it fall on the floor.</p>

<p>There are several Hebrew words which are used for the Lion,
but that which signifies the animal in its adult state is derived
from an Arabic word signifying strength; and therefore the
Lion is called the Strong-one, just as the Bat is called the Night-flier.
No epithet could be better deserved, for the Lion seems to
be a very incarnation of strength, and, even when dead, gives as
vivid an idea of concentrated power as when it was living.
And, when the skin is stripped from the body, the tremendous
muscular development never fails to create a sensation of awe.
The muscles of the limbs, themselves so hard as to blunt the
keen-edged knives employed by a dissecter, are enveloped in
their glittering sheaths, playing upon each other like well-oiled
machinery, and terminating in tendons seemingly strong as steel,
and nearly as impervious to the knife. Not until the skin is removed
can any one form a conception of the enormously powerful
muscles of the neck, which enable the Lion to lift the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
weighty prey which it kills, and to convey it to a place of
security.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LION REPLIES TO THE THUNDER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although usually unwilling to attack an armed man, it is one
of the most courageous animals in existence when it is driven to
fight, and if its anger is excited, it cares little for the number of
its foes, or the weapons with which they are armed. Even the
dreaded firearms lose their terrors to an angry Lion, while a
Lioness, who fears for the safety of her young, is simply the
most terrible animal in existence. We know how even a hen
will fight for her chickens, and how she has been known to beat
off the fox and the hawk by the reckless fury of her attack.
It may be easily imagined, therefore, that a Lioness actuated by
equal courage, and possessed of the terrible weapons given to
her by her Creator, would be an animal almost too formidable
for the conception of those who have not actually witnessed the
scene of a Lioness defending her little ones.</p>

<p>The roar of the Lion is another of the characteristics for which
it is celebrated. There is no beast that can produce a sound that
could for a moment be mistaken for the roar of the Lion. The
Lion has a habit of stooping his head towards the ground when
he roars, so that the terrible sound rolls along like thunder, and
reverberates in many an echo in the far distance. Owing to this
curious habit, the roar can be heard at a very great distance, but its
locality is rendered uncertain, and it is often difficult to be quite
sure whether the Lion is to the right or the left of the hearer.</p>

<p>There are few sounds which strike more awe than the Lion's
roar. Even at the Zoological Gardens, where the hearer knows
that he is in perfect safety, and where the Lion is enclosed in a
small cage faced with strong iron bars, the sound of the terrible
roar always has a curious effect upon the nerves. It is not
exactly fear, because the hearer knows that he is safe; but it is
somewhat akin to the feeling of mixed awe and admiration with
which one listens to the crashing thunder after the lightning has
sped its course. If such be the case when the Lion is safely
housed in a cage, and is moreover so tame that even if he did
escape, he would be led back by the keeper without doing any
harm, the effect of the roar must indeed be terrific when the
Lion is at liberty, when he is in his own country, and when the
shades of evening prevent him from being seen even at a short
distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>In the dark, there is no animal so invisible as a Lion. Almost
every hunter has told a similar story&mdash;of the Lion's approach at
night, of the terror displayed by dogs and cattle as he drew
near, and of the utter inability to see him, though he was so
close that they could hear his breathing. Sometimes, when he
has crept near an encampment, or close to a cattle inclosure, he
does not proceed any farther lest he should venture within the
radius illumined by the rays of the fire. So he crouches closely
to the ground, and, in the semi-darkness, looks so like a large
stone, or a little hillock, that any one might pass close to it
without perceiving its real nature. This gives the opportunity
for which the Lion has been watching, and in a moment he
strikes down the careless straggler, and carries off his prey to
the den. Sometimes, when very much excited, he accompanies
the charge with a roar, but, as a general fact, he secures his prey
in silence.</p>

<p>The roar of the Lion is very peculiar. It is not a mere outburst
of sound, but a curiously graduated performance. No description
of the Lion's roar is so vivid, so true, and so graphic as
that of Gordon Cumming: "One of the most striking things
connected with the Lion is his voice, which is extremely grand
and peculiarly striking. It consists at times of a low, deep
moaning, repeated five or six times, ending in faintly audible
sighs. At other times he startles the forest with loud, deep-toned,
solemn roars, repeated five or six times in quick succession,
each increasing in loudness to the third or fourth, when his
voice dies away in five or six low, muffled sounds, very much
resembling distant thunder. As a general rule, Lions roar during
the night, their sighing moans commencing as the shades of
evening envelop the forest, and continuing at intervals throughout
the night. In distant and secluded regions, however, I have
constantly heard them roaring loudly as late as nine or ten
o'clock on a bright sunny morning. In hazy and rainy weather
they are to be heard at every hour in the day, but their roar is
subdued."</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the dwelling-place of the Lion. This
animal always fixes its residence in the depths of some forest,
through which it threads its stealthy way with admirable certainty.
No fox knows every hedgerow, ditch, drain, and covert
better than the Lion knows the whole country around his den.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Each Lion seems to have his peculiar district, in which only
himself and his family will be found. These animals seem to
parcel out the neighbourhood among themselves by a tacit law
like that which the dogs of eastern countries have imposed upon
themselves, and which forbids them to go out of the district in
which they were born. During the night he traverses his
dominions; and, as a rule, he retires to his den as soon as the
sun is fairly above the horizon. Sometimes he will be in wait
for prey in the broadest daylight, but his ordinary habits are
nocturnal, and in the daytime he is usually asleep in his secret
dwelling-place.</p>

<p>We will now glance at a few of the passages in which the
Lion is mentioned in the Holy Scriptures, selecting those which
treat of its various characteristics.</p>

<p>The terrible strength of the Lion is the subject of repeated
reference. In the magnificent series of prophecies uttered by
Jacob on his deathbed, the power of the princely tribe of Judah
is predicted under the metaphor of a Lion&mdash;the beginning of its
power as a Lion's whelp, the fulness of its strength as an adult
Lion, and its matured establishment in power as the old Lion
that couches himself and none dares to disturb him. Then
Solomon, in the Proverbs, speaks of the Lion as the "strongest
among beasts, and that turneth not away for any."</p>

<p>Solomon also alludes to its courage in the same book, Prov.
xxviii. 1, in the well-known passage, "The wicked fleeth when
no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion." And,
in 2 Sam. xxiii. 20, the courage of Benaiah, one of the mighty
three of David's army, is specially honoured, because he fought
and killed a Lion single-handed, and because he conquered
"two lion-like men of Moab." David, their leader, had also distinguished
himself, when a mere keeper of cattle, by pursuing
and killing a Lion that had come to plunder his herd. In the
same book of Samuel which has just been quoted (xvii. 10),
the valiant men are metaphorically described as having the
hearts of Lions.</p>

<p>The ferocity of this terrible beast of prey is repeatedly mentioned,
and the Psalms are full of such allusions, the fury and
anger of enemies being compared to the attacks of the Lion.</p>

<p>Many passages refer to the Lion's roar, and it is remarkable
that the Hebrew language contains several words by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
different kind of roar is described. One word, for example,
represents the low, deep, thunder-like roar of the Lion seeking
its prey, and which has already been mentioned. This is the
word which is used in Amos iii. 4, "Will a lion roar in the
forest when he hath no prey?" and in this passage the word
which is translated as Lion signifies the animal when full grown
and in the prime of life. Another word is used to signify the
sudden exulting cry of the Lion as it leaps upon its victim. A
third is used for the angry growl with which a Lion resents any
endeavour to deprive it of its prey, a sound with which we are
all familiar, on a miniature scale, when we hear a cat growling
over a mouse which she has just caught. The fourth term signifies
the peculiar roar uttered by the young Lion after it has ceased
to be a cub and before it has attained maturity. This last term
is employed in Jer. li. 38, "They shall <em>roar</em> together like lions;
they shall <em>yell</em> as lions' whelps," in which passage two distinct
words are used, one signifying the roar of the Lion when searching
after prey, and the other the cry of the young Lions.</p>

<p>The prophet Amos, who in his capacity of herdsman was
familiar with the wild beasts, from which he had to guard his
cattle, makes frequent mention of the Lion, and does so with a force
and vigour that betoken practical experience. How powerful is
this imagery, "The lion hath roared; who will not fear? The Lord
God hath spoken; who can but prophesy?" Here we have the
picture of the man himself, the herdsman and prophet, who had
trembled many a night, as the Lions drew nearer and nearer;
and who heard the voice of the Lord, and his lips poured out
prophecy. Nothing can be more complete than the parallel
which he has drawn. It breathes the very spirit of piety, and
may bear comparison even with the prophecies of Isaiah for its
simple grandeur.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how the sacred writers have entered into the
spirit of the world around them, and how closely they observed
the minutest details even in the lives of the brute beasts. There
is a powerful passage in the book of Job, iv. 11, "The old
lion perisheth for lack of prey," in which the writer betrays his
thorough knowledge of the habits of the animal, and is aware
that the usual mode of a Lion's death is through hunger, in consequence
of his increasing inability to catch prey.</p>

<p>The nocturnal habits of the Lion and its custom of lying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wait for prey are often mentioned in the Scriptures. The former
habit is spoken of in that familiar and beautiful passage in
the Psalms (civ. 20), "Thou makest darkness, and it is night;
wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young
Lions roar after their prey; and seek their meat from God. The
sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down
in their dens."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">LION CARRYING HOME SUPPLIES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An animal so destructive among the flocks and herds could
not be allowed to carry out its depredations unchecked, and as
we have already seen, the warfare waged against it has been so
successful, that the Lions have long ago been fairly extirpated in
Palestine. The usual method of capturing or killing the Lion
was by pitfalls or nets, to both of which there are many references
in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>The mode of hunting the Lion with nets was identical with
that which is practised in India at the present time. The precise
locality of the Lion's dwelling-place having been discovered,
a circular wall of net is arranged round it, or if only a few nets
can be obtained, they are set in a curved form, the concave side
being towards the Lion. They then send dogs into the thicket,
hurl stones and sticks at the den, shoot arrows into it, fling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a><br /><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
burning torches at it, and so irritate and alarm the animal that it
rushes against the net, which is so made that it falls down and
envelopes the animal in its folds. If the nets be few, the drivers
go to the opposite side of the den, and induce the Lion to escape
in the direction where he sees no foes, but where he is sure to run
against the treacherous net. Other large and dangerous animals
were also captured by the same means.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="african" id="african"></a>
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="450" height="346" alt="african" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AFRICAN LIONS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another and more common, because an easier and a cheaper
method was, by digging a deep pit, covering the mouth with a
slight covering of sticks and earth, and driving the animal upon
the treacherous covering. It is an easier method than the net,
because after the pit is once dug, the only trouble lies in throwing
the covering over its mouth. But, it is not so well adapted
for taking beasts alive, as they are likely to be damaged, either
by the fall into the pit, or by the means used in getting them
out again. Animals, therefore, that are caught in pits are
generally, though not always, killed before they are taken out.
The net, however, envelops the animal so perfectly, and renders
it so helpless, that it can be easily bound and taken away. The
hunting net is very expensive, and requires a large staff of men to
work it, so that none but a rich man could use it in hunting.</p>

<p>The passages in which allusion is made to the use of the pitfall
in hunting are too numerous to be quoted, and it will be sufficient
to mention one or two passages, such as those wherein the
Psalmist laments that his enemies have hidden for him their net
in a pit, and that the proud have digged pits for him.</p>

<p>Lions that were taken in nets seem to have been kept alive
in dens, either as mere curiosities, or as instruments of royal
vengeance. Such seems to have been the object of the Lions
which were kept by Darius, into whose den Daniel was thrown,
by royal command, and which afterwards killed his accusers
when thrown into the same den. It is plain that the Lions kept
by Darius must have been exceedingly numerous, because they
killed at once the accusers of Daniel, who were many in number,
together with their wives and children, who, in accordance with
the cruel custom of that age and country, were partakers of
the same punishment with the real culprits. The whole of the
first part of Ezek. xix. alludes to the custom of taking Lions alive
and keeping them in durance afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the Lion was hunted as a sport, but this amusement
seems to have been restricted to the great men, on account
of its expensive nature. Such hunting scenes are graphically
depicted in the famous Nineveh sculptures, which represent the
hunters pursuing their mighty game in chariots, and destroying
them with arrows. Rude, and even conventional as are these
sculptures, they have a spirit, a force, and a truthfulness, that
prove them to have been designed by artists to whom the scene
was a familiar one.</p>

<p>Upon the African Continent the Lion reigns supreme, monarch
of the feline race.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of the distinction between the Asiatic
and African Lion, there seems to be scarcely sufficient grounds for
considering the very slight differences a sufficient warrant for constituting
separate species. From all accounts, it seems that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
habits of all Lions are very similar, and that a Lion acts like a
Lion whether found in Africa or Asia.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LAIR OF THE LION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An old Boer, as the Dutch settlers of Southern Africa are called,
gave me a most interesting account of an adventure with a Lion.</p>

<p>The man was a well-known hunter, and lived principally by the
sale of ivory and skins. He was accustomed each year to make a
trip into the game country, and traded with the Kaffirs, or native
blacks, under very favorable auspices. His stock in trade consisted
of guns and ammunition, several spans of fine oxen, some horses,
and about a dozen dogs.</p>

<p>A Lion which appeared to have been roaming about the country
happened to pass near this hunter's camp, and scenting the horses
and oxen, evidently thought that the location would suit him for a
short period. A dense wood situated about a mile from the camp
afforded shelter, and this spot the Lion selected as a favorable position
for his headquarters.</p>

<p>The hunter had not to wait for more than a day, before the suspicions
which had been aroused by some broad footmarks, which he
saw imprinted in the soil, were confirmed into a certainty that a
large Lion was concealed near his residence.</p>

<p>It now became a question of policy whether the Boer should
attack the Lion, or wait for the Lion to attack him. He thought
it possible that the savage beast, having been warned off by the
dogs, whose barking had been continued and furious during the
night on which the Lion was supposed to have passed, might think
discretion the better part of valor, and consequently would move
farther on, in search of a less carefully guarded locality upon
which to quarter himself. He determined, therefore, to wait, but
to use every precaution against a night-surprise.</p>

<p>The Lion, however, was more than a match for the man; for
during the second night a strong ox from his best span was quietly
carried off, and, although there was some commotion among the
dogs and cattle, it was then thought that the alarm had scared the
Lion away.</p>

<p>The morning light, however, showed that the beast had leaped
the fence which surrounded the camp, and, having killed the ox,
had evidently endeavored to scramble over it again with the ox in
his possession. The weight of the Lion and the ox had caused the
stakes to give way, and the Lion had easily carried off his prey
through the aperture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The track of the Lion was immediately followed by the Boer,
who took with him a negro and half a dozen of his best dogs. The
tracks were easily seen, and the hunter had no difficulty in deciding
that the Lion was in the wood previously mentioned. But this
in itself was no great advance, for the place was overgrown with a
dense thicket of thorn-bushes, creepers, and long grass, forming a
jungle so thick and impenetrable that for a man to enter seemed
almost impossible.</p>

<p>It was therefore agreed that the Boer should station himself on
one side, while the negro went to the other side of the jungle, the
dogs meanwhile being sent into the thicket.</p>

<p>This arrangement, it was hoped, would enable either the hunter
or the negro to obtain a shot; for they concluded that the dogs,
which were very courageous animals, would drive the Lion out of
the bushes.</p>

<p>The excited barking of the dogs soon indicated that they had
discovered the Lion, but they appeared to be unable to drive him
from his stronghold; for, although they would scamper away every
now and then, as though the enraged monster was chasing them,
still they returned to bark at the same spot.</p>

<p>Both of the hunters fired several shots, with the hope that a
stray bullet might find its way through the underwood to the heart
of the savage beast, but a great quantity of ammunition was expended
and no result achieved.</p>

<p>At length, as the dogs had almost ceased to bark, it was considered
advisable to call them off. But all the whistling and
shouting failed to recall more than two out of the six, and one of
these was fearfully wounded. The others, it was afterwards found,
had been killed by the Lion: a blow from his paw had sufficed to
break the back or smash the skull of all which had come within
his reach.</p>

<p>Thus the first attempt on the Lion was a total failure, and the
hunter returned home lamenting the loss of his dogs, and during
the night watched beside his enclosure; but the Lion did not pay
him a second visit.</p>

<p>Early on the following evening, accompanied by the negro, he
started afresh for the wood; and, having marked the spot from
which the Lion had on the former occasion quitted the dense
thorny jungle, the two hunters ascended a tree and watched during
the whole night in the hope of obtaining a shot at the hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
marauder. But while they were paying the residence of the Lion
a visit <em>he</em> favored the camp with a call, and this time, by way of
variety, carried away a very valuable horse, which he conveyed to
the wood, being wise enough to walk out and to return by a different
path from that he had previously used, consequently avoiding
the ambush prepared for him.</p>

<p>When the hunter returned to his camp, he was furious at this
new loss, and determined upon a plan which, though dangerous,
still appeared the most likely to insure the destruction of the
ravenous monster.</p>

<p>This plan was to enter the wood alone, without attendant or
dogs, and with noiseless, stealthy movements creep near enough
to the Lion to obtain a shot.</p>

<p>Now, when we consider the difficulty of moving through thick
bushes without making a noise, and remember the watchful habits
of every member of the cat tribe, we may be certain that to surprise
the Lion was a matter of extreme difficulty, and that the
probability was that the hunter would meet with disaster.</p>

<p>At about ten o'clock on the morning after the horse-slaughter,
the hunter started for the wood armed with a double-barrelled
smooth-bore gun, and prepared to put forth his utmost skill in
stalking his dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>Now, it is the nature of the Lion, when gorged, to sleep during
the day; and if the animal has carried off any prey, it usually
conceals itself near the remnants of its feast, to watch them until
ready for another meal.</p>

<p>The hunter was aware of this, and laid his plans very judiciously.
He approached the wood slowly and silently, found the track of
the Lion, and began tracing it to find the spot where the remains
of the horse could be seen.</p>

<p>He moved forward very slowly and with great caution, being
soon surrounded by the thick bushes, the brightness of the plain
also being succeeded by the deep gloom of the wood. Being an
experienced hand at bush-craft, he was able to walk or crawl without
causing either a dried stick to crack or a leaf to rustle, and he
was aware that his progress was without noise; for the small birds,
usually so watchful and alert, flew away only when he approached
close to them, thus showing that their eyes, and not their ears, had
made them conscious of the presence of man.</p>

<p>Birds and monkeys are the great obstacles in the bush to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a><br /><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
success of a surprise, for the birds fly from tree to tree and whistle
or twitter, whilst the monkeys chatter and grimace, expressing by
all sorts of actions that a strange creature is approaching. When,
therefore, the bushranger finds that birds and monkeys are unconscious
of his presence until they see him, he may be satisfied that
he has traversed the bush with tolerable silence, and has vanquished
such dangerous betrayers of his presence as dried sticks
and dead leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="listens" id="listens"></a>
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="listens" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LION LISTENS TO THE APPROACH OF THE HUNTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The hunter had not proceeded thus more than fifty yards into
the jungle, before he found indications that he was close upon the
lair of the Lion: a strong leonine scent was noticeable, and part of
the carcase of his horse was visible between the bushes. Instead,
therefore, of advancing farther, as an incautious or inexperienced
bushranger would have done, he crouched down behind a bush and
remained motionless.</p>

<p>All animals are aware of the advantages of a surprise, and the
cat tribe especially practise the ambuscading system. The hunter,
therefore, determined, if possible, to turn the tables on the Lion,
and to surprise, rather than to be surprised.</p>

<p>He concluded that the Lion, even when gorged with horseflesh,
would not be so neglectful of his safety as to sleep with more than
one eye closed, and that, although he had crept with great care
through the bush, he had probably, from some slight sound, caused
the Lion to be on the alert; if, therefore, he should approach the
carcase of the horse, he might be pounced upon at once.</p>

<p>After remaining silent and watchful for several minutes, the
hunter at length saw that an indistinctly-outlined object was moving
behind some large broad-leafed plants at about twenty paces
from him.</p>

<p>This object was the Lion. It was crouched behind some shrubs,
attentively watching the bushes where the hunter was concealed.
Its head only was clearly visible, the body being hidden by the
foliage.</p>

<p>It was evident that the Lion was suspicious of something, but
was not certain that anything had approached.</p>

<p>The hunter, knowing that this was a critical period for him,
remained perfectly quiet. He did not like to risk a shot at the
forehead of the Lion, for it would require a very sure aim to
insure a death-wound, and the number of twigs and branches
would be almost certain to deflect the bullet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lion, after a careful inspection, appeared to be satisfied, and
laid down behind the shrubs. The hunter then cocked both barrels
of his heavy gun and turned the muzzle slowly around, so that
he covered the spot on which the Lion lay, and shifted his position
so as to be well placed for a shot.</p>

<p>The slight noise he made in moving, attracted the attention of
the Lion, who immediately rose to his feet. A broadside shot,
which was the most sure, could not be obtained, so the hunter fired
at the head of the animal, aiming for a spot between the eyes.
The ball struck high, as is usually the case when the distance is
short, and the charge of powder heavy, but the Lion fell over on
its back, rising, however, almost immediately and uttering a terrific
roar.</p>

<p>In regaining its feet it turned its side to the hunter, giving him
the opportunity he had so anxiously waited for. Aiming at a
spot behind the shoulder, he fired again, and had the satisfaction
of seeing the savage beast, maddened by the pain of a mortal
wound, tearing up the ground in its fury within a very few paces
of his hiding-place.</p>

<p>By degrees its fierce roars subsided into angry growls, and the
growls into heavy moans, until the terrible voice was hushed and
silence reigned throughout the wood.</p>

<p>The hunter immediately started off home, and brought his
negroes and dogs to the spot, where they found stretched dead
upon the ground a Lion of the largest size.</p>

<p>Before sunset that evening its skin was pegged down at the
hunter's camp, and all were filled with delight, knowing that they
would be no more disturbed by the fierce marauder.</p>

<h2>THE LEOPARD.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Leopard not often mentioned in the Scriptures&mdash;its attributes exactly
described&mdash;Probability that several animals were classed under the name&mdash;How
the Leopard takes its prey&mdash;Craft of the Leopard&mdash;its ravages among the
flocks&mdash;The empire of man over the beast&mdash;The Leopard at Bay&mdash;Localities
wherein the Leopard lives&mdash;The skin of the Leopard&mdash;Various passages of
Scripture explained.</p></blockquote>


<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Leopard</span> but little is said in the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>In the New Testament this animal is only mentioned once,
and then in a metaphorical rather than a literal sense. In the
Old Testament it is casually mentioned seven times, and only in
two places is the word Leopard used in the strictly literal sense.
Yet, in those brief passages of Holy Writ, the various attributes
of the animal are delineated with such fidelity, that no one
could doubt that the Leopard was familiarly known in Palestine.
Its colour, its swiftness, its craft, its ferocity, and the nature of
its dwelling-place, are all touched upon in a few short sentences
scattered throughout the Old Testament, and even its peculiar
habits are alluded to in a manner that proves it to have been well
known at the time when the words were written.</p>

<p>It is my purpose in the following pages to give a brief account
of the Leopard of the Scriptures, laying most stress on the
qualities to which allusion is made, and then to explain the
passages in which the name of the animal occurs.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is probable that under the word Leopard
are comprehended three animals, two of which, at least, were
thought to be one species until the time of Cuvier. These three
animals are the <span class="smcap">Leopard</span> proper (<em>Leopardus varius</em>), the <span class="smcap">Ounce</span>
(<em>Leopardus uncia</em>), and the <span class="smcap">Chetah</span>, or <span class="smcap">Hunting Leopard</span> (<em>Gueparda
jubata</em>). All these three species belong to the same family
of animals; all are spotted and similar in colour, all are nearly
alike in shape, and all are inhabitants of Asia, while two of
them, the Leopard and the Chetah, are also found in Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to mention that the Leopard is a beast
of prey belonging to the cat tribe, that its colour is tawny,
variegated with rich black spots, and that it is a fierce and
voracious animal, almost equally dreaded by man and beast. It
inhabits many parts of Africa and Asia, and in those portions of
the country which are untenanted by mankind, it derives all its
sustenance from the herb-eating animals of the same tracts.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="leopard" id="leopard"></a>
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="450" height="448" alt="leopard" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LEOPARD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To deer and antelopes it is a terrible enemy, and in spite of
their active limbs, seldom fails in obtaining its prey. Swift as
is the Leopard, for a short distance, and wonderful as its spring,
it has not the enduring speed of the deer or antelope, animals
which are specially formed for running, and which, if a limb is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
shattered, can run nearly as fast and quite as far on three legs
as they can when all four limbs are uninjured. Instinctively
knowing its inferiority in the race, the Leopard supplies by
cunning the want of enduring speed.</p>

<p>It conceals itself in some spot whence it can see far around
without being seen, and thence surveys the country. A tree is
the usual spot selected for this purpose, and the Leopard, after
climbing the trunk by means of its curved talons, settles itself
in the fork of the branches, so that its body is hidden by the
boughs, and only its head is shown between them. With such
scrupulous care does it conceal itself, that none but a practised
hunter can discover it, while any one who is unaccustomed to
the woods cannot see the animal even when the tree is pointed
out to him.</p>

<p>As soon as the Leopard sees the deer feeding at a distance, he
slips down the tree and stealthily glides off in their direction.
He has many difficulties to overcome, because the deer are
among the most watchful of animals, and if the Leopard were
to approach to the windward, they would scent him while he
was yet a mile away from them. If he were to show himself
but for one moment in the open ground he would be seen, and
if he were but to shake a branch or snap a dry twig he would
be heard. So, he is obliged to approach them against the wind,
to keep himself under cover, and yet to glide so carefully along
that the heavy foliage of the underwood shall not be shaken, and
the dry sticks and leaves which strew the ground shall not be
broken. He has also to escape the observation of certain birds
and beasts which inhabit the woods, and which would certainly
set up their alarm-cry as soon as they saw him, and so give
warning to the wary deer, which can perfectly understand a cry
of alarm, from whatever animal it may happen to proceed.</p>

<p>Still, he proceeds steadily on his course, gliding from one
covert to another, and often expending several hours before he
can proceed for a mile. By degrees he contrives to come tolerably
close to them, and generally manages to conceal himself in
some spot towards which the deer are gradually feeding their
way. As soon as they are near enough, he collects himself for
a spring, just as a cat does when she leaps on a bird, and dashes
towards the deer in a series of mighty bounds. For a moment
or two they are startled and paralysed with fear at the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
appearance of their enemy, and thus give him time to get among
them. Singling out some particular animal, he leaps upon it,
strikes it down with one blow of his paw, and then, couching
on the fallen animal, he tears open its throat, and laps the
flowing blood.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 336px;"><a name="attacking" id="attacking"></a>
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="336" height="600" alt="attacking" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">LEOPARD ATTACKING A HERD OF DEER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this manner does it obtain its prey when it lives in the
desert, but when it happens to be in the neighbourhood of
human habitations, it acts in a different manner. Whenever man
settles himself in any place, his presence is a signal for the
beasts of the desert and forest to fly. The more timid, such as
the deer and antelope, are afraid of him, and betake themselves
as far away as possible. The more savage inhabitants of the
land, such as the lion, leopard, and other animals, wage an unequal
war against him for a time, but are continually driven
farther and farther away, until at last they are completely expelled
from the country. The predaceous beasts are, however, loth
to retire, and do so by very slow degrees. They can no longer
support themselves on the deer and antelopes, but find a simple
substitute for them in the flocks and herds which man introduces,
and in the seizing of which there is as much craft required
as in the catching of the fleeter and wilder animals.
Sheep and goats cannot run away like the antelopes, but they
are penned so carefully within inclosures, and guarded so
watchfully by herdsmen and dogs, that the Leopard is obliged to
exert no small amount of cunning before it can obtain a meal.</p>

<p>Sometimes it creeps quietly to the fold, and escapes the notice
of the dogs, seizes upon a sheep, and makes off with it before
the alarm is given. Sometimes it hides by the wayside, and as
the flock pass by it dashes into the midst of them, snatches up a
sheep, and disappears among the underwood on the opposite
side of the road. Sometimes it is crafty enough to deprive the
fold of its watchful guardian. Dogs which are used to Leopard-hunting
never attack the animal, though they are rendered
furious by the sound of its voice. They dash at it as if they
meant to devour it, but take very good care to keep out of reach
of its terrible paws. By continually keeping the animal at bay,
they give time for their master to come up, and generally contrive
to drive it into a tree, where it can be shot.</p>

<p>But instances have been known where the Leopard has taken
advantage of the dogs, and carried them off in a very cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
manner. It hides itself tolerably near the fold, and then begins
to growl in a low voice. The dogs think that they hear a
Leopard at a distance, and dash towards the sound with
furious barks and yells. In so doing, they are sure to pass by
the hiding-place of the Leopard, which springs upon them
unawares, knocks one of them over, and bounds away to its den
in the woods. It does not content itself with taking sheep or
goats from the fold, but is also a terrible despoiler of the hen-roosts,
destroying great numbers in a single night when once it
contrives to find its way into the house.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="leaps" id="leaps"></a>
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="600" height="339" alt="leaps" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LEOPARD LEAPS UPON HIS PREY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As an instance of the cunning which seems innate in the
Leopard, I may mention that whenever it takes up its abode
near a village, it does not meddle with the flocks and herds of
its neighbours, but prefers to go to some other village at a distance
for food, thus remaining unsuspected almost at the very
doors of the houses.</p>

<p>In general, it does not willingly attack mankind, and at all
events seems rather to fear the presence of a full-grown man.
But, when wounded or irritated, all sense of fear is lost in an
overpowering rush of fury, and it then becomes as terrible a foe
as the lion himself. It is not so large nor so strong, but it is
more agile and quicker in its movements; and when it is seized
with one of these paroxysms of anger, the eye can scarcely
follow it as it darts here and there, striking with lightning
rapidity, and dashing at any foe within reach. Its whole shape
seems to be transformed, and absolutely to swell with anger; its
eyes flash with fiery lustre, its ears are thrown back on the
head, and it continually utters alternate snarls and yells of rage.
It is hardly possible to recognise the graceful, lithe glossy
creature, whose walk is so noiseless, and whose every movement
is so easy, in the furious passion-swollen animal that flies at
every foe with blind fury, and pours out sounds so fierce and
menacing that few men, however well armed, will care to face it.</p>

<p>As is the case with most of the cat tribe, the Leopard is an
excellent climber, and can ascend trees and traverse their boughs
without the least difficulty. It is so fond of trees, that it is
seldom to be seen except in a well-wooded district. Its
favourite residence is a forest where there is plenty of underwood,
at least six or seven feet in height, among which trees are
sparingly interspersed. When crouched in this cover it is practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a><br /><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
invisible, even though its body may be within arm's
length of a passenger. The spotted body harmonizes so perfectly
with the broken lights and deep shadows of the foliage
that even a practised hunter will not enter a covert in search of
a Leopard unless he is accompanied by dogs. The instinct which
teaches the Leopard to choose such localities is truly wonderful,
and may be compared with that of the tiger, which cares little
for underwood, but haunts the grass jungles, where the long,
narrow blades harmonize with the stripes which decorate
its body.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 346px;"><a name="waiting" id="waiting"></a>
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="346" height="600" alt="waiting" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WAITING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The skin of the Leopard has always been highly valued on
account of its beauty, and in Africa, at the present day, a robe
made of its spotted skin is as much an adjunct of royalty as is
the ermine the emblem of judicial dignity in England. In more
ancient times, a leopard skin was the official costume of a priest,
the skin being sometimes shaped into a garment, and sometimes
thrown over the shoulders and the paws crossed over the breast.</p>

<p>Such is a general history of the Leopard. We will now proceed
to the various passages in which it is mentioned, beginning
with its outward aspect.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Hebrew word Namer signifies "spotted,"
and is given to the animal in allusion to its colours. The reader
will now see how forcible is the lament of Jeremiah, "Can the
Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots?" Literally,
"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the spotted one his
spots?"</p>

<p>The agility and swiftness of the Leopard are alluded to in
the prediction by the prophet Habakkuk of the vengeance that
would come upon Israel through the Chaldeans. In chap. i. 5,
we read: "I will work a work in your days, which ye will not
believe though it be told you. For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,
that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the
breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling-places that are not
theirs. They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and
their dignity shall proceed of themselves. Their horses also are
swifter than the Leopards, and are more fierce than the evening
wolves."</p>

<p>The craftiness of the Leopard, and the manner in which it
lies in wait for its prey, are alluded to in more than one passage
of Holy Writ. Hosea the prophet alludes to the Leopard in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
few simple words which display an intimate acquaintance with
the habits of this formidable animal, and in this part of his
prophecies he displays that peculiar local tone which distinguishes
his writings. Speaking of the Israelites under the
metaphor of a flock, or a herd, he proceeds to say: "According
to their pasture so were they filled; they were filled, and their
heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. Therefore
I will be unto them as a lion, as a Leopard by the way will I
observe them." The reader will note the peculiar force of this
sentence, whereby God signifies that He will destroy them
openly, as a lion rushes on its prey, and that he will chastise
them unexpectedly, as if it were a Leopard crouching by the
wayside, and watching for the flock to pass, that it may spring
on its prey unexpectedly. The same habit of the Leopard
is also alluded to by Jeremiah, who employs precisely the same
imagery as is used by Habakkuk. See Jer. v. 5, 6, "These have
altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. Wherefore
a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the
evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their
cities." It is evident from the employment of this image by
two prophets, the one being nearly a hundred years before the
other, that the crafty, insidious habits of the Leopard were well
known in Palestine, and that the metaphor would tell with full
force among those to whom it was addressed.</p>

<h2>THE CAT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Cat never mentioned by name in the canonical Scriptures, and only once in
the Apocrypha&mdash;The Cat domesticated among the Egyptians, and trained in
bird-catching&mdash;Neglected capabilities of the Cat&mdash;Anecdote of an English
Cat that caught fish for her master&mdash;Presumed reason why the Scriptures are
silent about the Cat&mdash;The Cat mentioned by Baruch.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is a very remarkable circumstance that the word <span class="smcap">Cat</span> is not
once mentioned in the whole of the canonical Scriptures, and
only once in the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, as is well known, kept Cats domesticated in
their houses, a fact which is mentioned by Herodotus, in his
second book, and the 66th and 67th chapters. After describing
the various animals which were kept and fed by this nation, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
proceeds to narrate the habits of the Cat, and writes as follows:
"When a fire takes place, a supernatural impulse seizes the
cats. For the Egyptians, standing at a distance, take care of
the cats and neglect to quench the fire; but the cats make
their escape, and leaping over the men, cast themselves into the
fire, and when this occurs, great lamentations are made among
the Egyptians. In whatever house a cat dies of a natural death,
all the family shave their eyebrows. All cats that die are
carried to certain sacred houses, where, after being embalmed,
they are buried in the city of Bubastis."</p>

<p>Now, as many of those cat-mummies have been discovered in
good preservation, the species has been identified with the
Egyptian Cat of the present day, which is scientifically termed
<em>Felis maniculatus</em>. Not only did the Egyptians keep Cats at
their houses, but, as is shown by certain sculptures, took the
animals with them when they went bird-catching, and employed
them in securing their prey. Some persons have doubted this
statement, saying, that in the first place, the Cat is not possessed
of sufficient intelligence for the purpose; and that in the second
place, as the hunter is represented as catching wild fowl, the Cat
would not be able to assist him, because it would not enter the
water. Neither objection is valid, nor would have been made
by a naturalist.</p>

<p>There are no grounds whatever for assuming that the Cat has
not sufficient intelligence to aid its master in hunting. On the
contrary, there are many familiar instances where the animal
has been trained, even in this country, to catch birds and other
game, and bring its prey home. By nature the Cat is an accomplished
hunter, and, like other animals of the same disposition,
can be taught to use its powers for mankind. We all know that
the chetah, a member of the same tribe, is in constant use at
the present day, and we learn from ancient sculptures that the
lion was employed for the same purpose. Passing from land to
water, mankind has succeeded in teaching the seal and the otter
to plunge into the water, catch their finny prey, and deliver it to
their owners. Among predaceous birds, we have trained the
eagle, the falcon, and various hawks, to assist us in hunting the
finned and feathered tribes, while we have succeeded in teaching
the cormorant to catch fish for its master, and not for itself.
Why, then, should the Cat be excepted from a rule so general?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The fact is, the Cat has been, although domesticated for so
many centuries, a comparatively neglected animal; and it is the
fashion to heap upon it the contumacious epithets of sullen,
treacherous, selfish, spiteful, and intractable, just as we take as
our emblems of stupidity the ass and the goose, which are
really among the most cunning of the lower animals. We have
never tried to teach the Cat the art of hunting for her owners,
but that is no reason for asserting that the animal could not be
taught.</p>

<p>As to entering the water, every one who is familiar with the
habits of the Cat knows perfectly well that the Cat will voluntarily
enter water in chase of prey. A Cat does not like to wet
her feet, and will not enter the water without a very powerful
reason, but when that motive is supplied, she has no hesitation
about it. A curious and valuable confirmation of this fact
appeared some time ago in "The Field" newspaper, in which
was recorded the history of an old fisherman, whose Cat invariably
went to sea with him, and as invariably used to leap overboard,
seize fish in her mouth, and bring them to the side of the
boat, where her kindly owner could lift her out, together with
the captured fish.</p>

<p>The Cat, then, having been the favoured companion of the
Egyptians, among whom the Israelites lived while they multiplied
from a family into a nation, it does seem very remarkable
that the sacred writers should not even mention it. There
is no prohibition of the animal, even indirectly, in the Mosaic
law; but it may be the case that the Israelites repudiated the
Cat simply because it was so favoured by their former masters.</p>

<h2>THE DOG.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Antipathy displayed by Orientals towards the Dog, and manifested throughout
the Scriptures&mdash;Contrast between European and Oriental Dogs&mdash;Habits of the
Dogs of Palestine&mdash;The City Dogs and their singular organization&mdash;The herdsman's
Dog&mdash;Various passages of Scripture&mdash;Dogs and the crumbs&mdash;their

Oriental Dog&mdash;Albert Smith's account of the Dogs at Constantinople&mdash;The
Dervish and his Dogs&mdash;The Greyhound&mdash;Uncertainty of the word.</p></blockquote>


<p>Scarcely changed by the lapse of centuries, the Oriental of the
present day retains most of the peculiarities which distinguished
him throughout the long series of years during which the books
of sacred Scripture were given to the world. In many of these
characteristics he differs essentially from Europeans of the present
day, and exhibits a tone of mind which seems to be not
merely owing to education, but to be innate and inherent in
the race.</p>

<p>One of these remarkable characteristics is the strange loathing
with which he regards the Dog. In all other parts of the
world, the Dog is one of the most cherished and valued of
animals, but among those people whom we popularly class under
the name of Orientals, the Dog is detested and despised. As the
sacred books were given to the world through the mediumship
of Orientals, we find that this feeling towards the Dog is manifested
whenever the animal is mentioned; and whether we turn
to the books of the Law, the splendid poetry of the Psalms and
the book of Job, the prophetical or the historical portions of the
Old Testament, we find the name of the Dog repeatedly mentioned;
and in every case in connexion with some repulsive
idea. If we turn from the Old to the New Testament, we find
the same idea manifested, whether in the Gospels, the Epistles,
or the Revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>To the mind of the true Oriental the very name of the Dog
carries with it an idea of something utterly repugnant to his
nature, and he does not particularly like even the thought of the
animal coming across his mind. And this is the more extraordinary,
because at the commencement and termination of
their history the Dog was esteemed by their masters. The
Egyptians, under whose rule they grew to be a nation, knew
the value of the Dog, and showed their appreciation in the many
works of art which have survived to our time. Then the
Romans, under whose iron grasp the last vestiges of nationality
crumbled away, honoured and respected the Dog, made it their
companion, and introduced its portrait into their houses. But,
true to their early traditions, the Jews of the East have ever held
the Dog in the same abhorrence as is manifested by their present
masters, the followers of Mahommed.</p>

<p>Owing to the prevalence of this feeling, the Dogs of Oriental
towns are so unlike their more fortunate European relatives, that
they can hardly be recognised as belonging to the same species.
In those lands the traveller finds that there is none of the
wonderful variety which so distinguishes the Dog of Europe.
There he will never see the bluff, sturdy, surly, faithful mastiff,
the slight gazelle-like greyhound, the sharp, intelligent terrier,
the silent, courageous bulldog, the deep-voiced, tawny bloodhound,
the noble Newfoundland, the clever, vivacious poodle, or
the gentle, silken-haired spaniel.</p>

<p>As he traverses the streets, he finds that all the dogs are
alike, and that all are gaunt, hungry, half starved, savage, and
cowardly, more like wolves than dogs, and quite as ready as
wolves to attack when they fancy they can do so with safety.
They prowl about the streets in great numbers, living, as they
best can, on any scraps of food that they may happen to find.
They have no particular masters, and no particular homes.
Charitable persons will sometimes feed them, but will never
make companions of them, feeling that the very contact of a dog
would be a pollution. They are certainly useful animals, because
they act as scavengers, and will eat almost any animal
substance that comes in their way.</p>

<p>The strangest part of their character is the organization which
prevails among them. By some extraordinary means they divide
the town into districts, and not one dog ever ventures out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that particular district to which it is attached. The boundaries,
although invisible, are as effectual as the loftiest walls, and not
even the daintiest morsel will tempt a dog to pass the mysterious
line which forms the boundary of his district. Generally,
these bands of dogs are so savage that any one who is obliged to
walk in a district where the dogs do not know him is forced to
carry a stout stick for his protection. Like their European relatives,
they have great dislike towards persons who are dressed
after a fashion to which they are unaccustomed, and therefore
are sure to harass any one who comes from Europe and wears
the costume of his own country. As is customary among
animals which unite themselves in troops, each band is under the
command of a single leader, whose position is recognised and his
authority acknowledged by all the members.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="dog" id="dog"></a>
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="many dogs" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DOGS IN AN EASTERN CITY AT NIGHT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These peculiarities are to be seen almost exclusively in the
dogs which run wild about the towns, because there is abundant
evidence in the Scriptures that the animal was used in a
partially domesticated state, certainly for the protection of their
herds, and possibly for the guardianship of their houses. That
the Dog was employed for the first of these purposes is shown
in Job xxx. i: "But now they that are younger than I have me
in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set
with the dogs of my flock." And that the animal was used for
the protection of houses is thought by some commentators to be
shown by the well-known passage in Is. lvi. 10: "His watchmen
are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs,
they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber."
Still, it is very probable that in this passage the reference is not
made to houses, but to the flocks and herds which these watchmen
ought to have guarded.</p>

<p>The rooted dislike and contempt felt by the Israelites towards
the Dog is seen in numerous passages. Even in that sentence
from Job which has just been quoted, wherein the writer passionately
deplores the low condition into which he has fallen,
and contrasts it with his former high estate, he complains that
he is despised by those whose fathers he held even in less esteem
than the dogs which guarded his herds. There are several references
to the Dog in the books of Samuel, in all of which the
name of the animal is mentioned contemptuously. For example,
when David accepted the challenge of Goliath, and went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
meet his gigantic enemy without the ordinary protection of
mail, and armed only with a sling and his shepherd's staff
Goliath said to him, "Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with
staves?" (1 Sam. xvii. 43.) And in the same book, chapter
xxiv. 14, David remonstrates with Saul for pursuing so insignificant
a person as himself, and said, "After whom is the King
of Israel come out? after a dead dog, after a flea."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="shimei" id="shimei"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SHIMEI EXULTING OVER KING DAVID.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same metaphor is recorded in the second book of the
same writer. Once it was employed by Mephibosheth, the lame
son of Jonathan, when extolling the generosity of David, then
King of Israel in the place of his grandfather Saul: "And he
bowed himself, and said, 'What is thy servant, that thou
shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?'" (2 Sam. ix. 8.)
In the same book, chapter xvi. 9, Abishai applies this contemptuous
epithet to Shimei, who was exulting over the troubled
monarch with all the insolence of a cowardly nature, "Why
should this dead dog curse my lord the king?" Abner also
makes use of a similar expression, "Am I a dog's head?" And
we may also refer to the familiar passage in 2 Kings viii. 13,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Elisha had prophesied to Hazael that he would become king on
the death of Ben-hadad, and that he would work terrible mischief
in the land. Horrified at these predictions, or at all events
pretending to be so, he replied, "But what, is thy servant a dog,
that he should do this great thing?"</p>

<p>If we turn from the Old to the New Testament, we find the
same contemptuous feeling displayed towards the Dog. It is
mentioned as an intolerable aggravation of the sufferings endured
by Lazarus the beggar as he lay at the rich man's gate, that the
dogs came and licked his sores. In several passages, the word
Dog is employed as a metaphor for scoffers, or unclean persons,
or sometimes for those who did not belong to the Church,
whether Jewish or Christian. In the Sermon on the Mount
our Lord himself uses this image, "Give not that which is holy
unto dogs" (Matt. vii. 6.) In the same book, chapter xv. 26,
Jesus employs the same metaphor when speaking to the
Canaanitish woman who had come to ask him to heal her
daughter: "It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast
it to dogs." And that she understood the meaning of the words
is evident from her answer, in which faith and humility are so
admirably blended. Both St. Paul and St. John employ the
word Dog in the same sense. In his epistle to the Philippians,
chapter iii. 2, St. Paul writes, "Beware of dogs, beware of evil
workers." And in the Revelation, chapter xxii. 14, these words
occur: "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they
may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
gates to the city; for without are dogs, and sorcerers, ... and
murderers, and idolaters, and whomsoever loveth and maketh
a lie."</p>

<p>That the dogs of ancient times formed themselves into bands
just as they do at present is evident from many passages of
Scripture, among which may be mentioned those sentences from
the Psalms, wherein David is comparing the assaults of his
enemies to the attacks of the dogs which infested the city.
"Thou hast brought me into the dust of death; for dogs have
compassed me, the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me."
This passage will be better appreciated when the reader has
perused the following extract from a recent work by Signor
Pierotti. After giving a general account of the Dogs of Palestine
and their customs, he proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"In Jerusalem, and in the other towns, the dogs have an
organization of their own. They are divided into families and
districts, especially in the night time, and no one of them
ventures to quit his proper quarter; for if he does, he is immediately
attacked by all the denizens of that into which he
intrudes, and is driven back, with several bites as a reminder.
Therefore, when an European is walking through Jerusalem by
night, he is always followed by a number of canine attendants,
and greeted at every step with growls and howls. These tokens
of dislike, however, are not intended for him, but for his
followers, who are availing themselves of his escort to pass
unmolested from one quarter to another.</p>

<p>"During a very hard winter, I fed many of the dogs who frequented
the road which I traversed almost every evening, and
afterwards, each time that I passed, I received the homage not only
of the individuals, but of the whole band to which they belonged,
for they accompanied me to the limits of their respective jurisdictions
and were ready to follow me to my own house, if I did but
give them a sign of encouragement, coming at my beck from any
distance. They even recollected the signal two years afterwards,
though it was but little that I had given them."</p>

<p>The account which this experienced writer gives of the animal
presents a singular mixture of repulsive and pleasing traits,
the latter being attributable to the true nature of the Dog, and
the former to the utter neglect with which it is treated. He
remarks that the dogs which run wild in the cities of Palestine
are ill-favoured, ill-scented, and ill-conditioned beasts, more like
jackals or wolves than dogs, and covered with scars, which
betoken their quarrelsome nature. Yet, the same animals lose
their wild, savage disposition, as soon as any human being
endeavours to establish that relationship which was evidently
intended to exist between man and the dog. How readily even
these despised and neglected animals respond to the slightest
advance, has been already shown by Sig. Pierotti's experience,
and there is no doubt that these tawny, short-haired, wolf-like
animals, could be trained as perfectly as their more favoured
brethren of the western world.</p>

<p>As in the olden times, so at the present day, the dogs lie
about in the streets, dependent for their livelihood upon the offal
that is flung into the roads, or upon the chance morsels that may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be thrown to them. An allusion to this custom is made in the
well-known passage in Matt. xv. The reader will remember the
circumstance that a woman of Canaan, and therefore not an
Israelite, came to Jesus, and begged him to heal her daughter,
who was vexed with a devil. Then, to try her faith, He said, "It
is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."
And she said, "Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
which fall from their master's table." Now, the "crumbs" which
are here mentioned are the broken pieces of bread which were
used at table, much as bread is sometimes used in eating fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
The form of the "loaves" being flat, and much like that of the
oat-cake of this country, adapted them well to the purpose.
The same use of broken bread is alluded to in the parable of
Lazarus, who desired to be fed with the crumbs that fell from
the rich man's table, <em>i. e.</em> to partake of the same food as the dogs
which swarmed round him and licked his sores.</p>

</div>

<p>The "crumbs," however liberally distributed, would not nearly
suffice for the subsistence of the canine armies, and their chief
support consists of the offal, which is rather too plentifully flung
into the streets. If the body of any animal, not excluding
their own kind, be found lying in the streets, the dogs will
assemble round it, and tear it to pieces, and they have no
scruples even in devouring a human body. Of course, owing
to the peculiar feeling entertained by the Orientals towards
the Dog, no fate can be imagined more repulsive to the feelings
of humanity than to be eaten by dogs; and therein lies the
terror of the fate which was prophesied of Ahab and Jezebel.
Moreover, the blood, even of the lower animals, was held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
great sanctity, and it was in those days hardly possible to invoke
a more dreadful fate upon any one than that his blood should be
lapped by dogs.</p>

<p>We lose much of the real force of the Scriptures, if we do not
possess some notion of the manners and customs of Palestine
and the neighbouring countries, as well as of the tone of mind
prevalent among the inhabitants. In our own country, that any
one should be eaten by dogs would be a fate so contrary to
usage, that we can hardly conceive its possibility, and such a
fate would be out of the ordinary course of events. But, if such
a fate should happen to befall any one, we should have no
stronger feeling of pity than the natural regret that the dead
person was not buried with Christian rites.</p>

<p>But, with the inhabitants of Palestine, such an event was by
no means unlikely. It was, and is still, the custom to bury the
corpse almost as soon as life has departed, and such would
ordinarily have been the case with the dead body of Jezebel.
But, through fear of the merciless Jehu, by whose command she
had been flung from the window of her own palace, no one
dared to remove her mangled body. The dogs, therefore, seized
upon their prey; and, even before Jehu had risen from the
banquet with which he celebrated his deed, nothing was left of
the body but the skull, the feet, and the hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="syrian" id="syrian"></a>
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="300" height="192" alt="syrian" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SYRIAN DOG.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In Mr. Tristram's work, the author has recognised the true
dog nature, though concealed behind an uninviting form: "Our
watch-dog, Beirût, attached himself instinctively to Wilhelm,
though his canine instinct soon taught him to recognise every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
one of our party of fourteen, and to cling to the tents, whether
in motion or at rest, as his home. Poor Beirût! though the
veriest pariah in appearance, thy plebeian form encased as noble
a dog-heart as ever beat at the sound of a stealthy step."</p>

<p>The same author records a very remarkable example of the
sagacity of the native Dog, and the fidelity with which it will
keep guard over the property of its master. "The guard-house
provided us, unasked, with an invaluable and vigilant sentry,
who was never relieved, nor ever quitted the post of duty. The
poor Turkish conscript, like every other soldier in the world, is
fond of pets, and in front of the grim turret that served for a
guard-house was a collection of old orange-boxes and crates,
thickly peopled with a garrison of dogs of low degree, whose
attachment to the spot was certainly not purchased by the
loaves and fishes which fell to their lot.</p>

<p>"One of the family must indeed have had hard times, for she
had a family of no less than five dependent on her exertions,
and on the superfluities of the sentries' mess. With a sagacity
almost more than canine, the poor gaunt creature had scarcely
seen our tents pitched before she came over with all her litter
and deposited them in front of our tent. At once she scanned
the features of every member of the encampment, and introduced
herself to our notice. During the week of our stay, she never
quitted her post, or attempted any depredation on our kitchen-tent,
which might have led to her banishment. Night and day
she proved a faithful and vigilant sentry, permitting no stranger,
human or canine, European or Oriental, to approach the tents
without permission, but keeping on the most familiar terms with
ourselves and our servants.</p>

<p>"On the morning of our departure, no sooner had she seen our
camp struck, than she conveyed her puppies back to their old
quarters in the orange-box, and no entreaties or bribes could
induce her to accompany us. On three subsequent visits to
Jerusalem, the same dog acted in a similar way, though no
longer embarrassed by family cares, and would on no account
permit any strange dog, nor even her companions at the guard-house,
to approach within the tent ropes."</p>

<p>After perusing this account of the Dog of Palestine, two
points strike the reader. The first is the manner in which the
Dog, in spite of all the social disadvantages under which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
labours, displays one of the chief characteristics of canine
nature, namely, the yearning after human society. The animal
in question had already attached herself to the guard-house,
where she could meet with some sort of human converse, though
the inborn prejudices of the Moslem would prevent the soldiers
from inviting her to associate with them, as would certainly
have been done by European soldiers. She nestled undisturbed
in the orange-box, and, safe under the protection of the guard,
brought up her young family in their immediate neighbourhood.
But, as soon as Europeans arrived, her instinct told her
that they would be closer associates than the Turkish soldiers
who were quartered in the guard-house, and accordingly she
removed herself and her family to the shelter of their tents.</p>

<p>Herein she carried out the leading principle of a dog's nature.
A dog <em>must</em> have a master, or at all events a mistress, and just
in proportion as he is free from human control, does he become
less dog-like and more wolf-like. In fact, familiar intercourse
with mankind is an essential part of a dog's true character, and
the animal seems to be so well aware of this fact, that he will
always contrive to find a master of some sort, and will endure a
life of cruel treatment at the hands of a brutal owner rather
than have no master at all.</p>

<p>The second point in this account is the singular local instinct
which characterises the Dogs of Palestine and other eastern
countries, and which is as much inbred in them as the faculty
of marking game in the pointer, the combative nature in the
bulldog, the exquisite scent in the bloodhound, and the love of
water in the Newfoundland dog. In this country, we fancy that
the love of locality belongs especially to the cat, and that the
Dog cares little for place, and much for man. But, in this case,
we find that the local instinct overpowered the yearning for
human society. Fond as was this dog of her newly-found
friends, and faithful as she was in her self-imposed service, she
would not follow them away from the spot where she had been
born, and where she had produced her own young.</p>

<p>This curious love for locality has evidently been derived
from the traditional custom of successive generations, which has
passed from the realm of reason into that of instinct. The
reader will remember that Sig. Pierotti mentions an instance
where the dogs which he had been accustomed to feed would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
follow him as far as the limits of their particular district, but
would go no farther. The late Albert Smith, in his "Month at
Constantinople," gives a similar example of this characteristic.
He first describes the general habits of the dogs.</p>

<p>On the first night of his arrival, he could not sleep, and went
to the window to look out in the night. "The noise I heard then
I shall never forget. To say that if all the sheep-dogs, in going
to Smithfield on a market-day, had been kept on the constant
bark, and pitted against the yelping curs upon all the carts
in London, they could have given any idea of the canine uproar
that now first astonished me, would be to make the feeblest of
images. The whole city rang with one vast riot. Down below
me, at Tophané&mdash;over-about Stamboul&mdash;far away at Scutari&mdash;the
whole sixty thousand dogs that are said to overrun Constantinople
appeared engaged in the most active extermination
of each other, without a moment's cessation. The yelping, howling,
barking, growling, and snarling, were all merged into one
uniform and continuous even sound, as the noise of frogs
becomes when heard at a distance. For hours there was no
lull. I went to sleep, and woke again, and still, with my windows
open, I heard the same tumult going on; nor was it until
daybreak that anything like tranquillity was restored.</p>

<p>"Going out in the daytime, it is not difficult to find traces of
the fights of the night about the limbs of all the street dogs.
There is not one, among their vast number, in the possession of
a perfect skin. Some have their ears gnawed away or pulled off;
others have their eyes taken out; from the backs and haunches
of others perfect steaks of flesh had been torn away; and all
bear the scars of desperate combats.</p>

<p>"Wild and desperate as is their nature, these poor animals
are susceptible of kindness. If a scrap of bread is thrown to
one of them now and then, he does not forget it; for they have,
at times, a hard matter to live&mdash;not the dogs amongst the shops
of Galata or Stamboul, but those whose 'parish' lies in the large
burying-grounds and desert places without the city; for each
keeps, or rather is kept, to his district, and if he chanced to
venture into a strange one, the odds against his return would be
very large. One battered old animal, to whom I used occasionally
to toss a scrap of food, always followed me from the
hotel to the cross street in Pera, where the two soldiers stood on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
guard, but would never come beyond this point. He knew the
fate that awaited him had he done so; and therefore, when I
left him, he would lie down in the road, and go to sleep until
I came back.</p>

<p>"When a horse or camel dies, and is left about the roads near
the city, the bones are soon picked very clean by these dogs,
and they will carry the skulls or pelves to great distances. I was
told that they will eat their dead fellows&mdash;a curious fact, I
believe, in canine economy. They are always troublesome, not
to say dangerous, at night; and are especially irritated by
Europeans, whom they will single out amongst a crowd of
Levantines."</p>

<p>In the same work there is a short description of a solitary
dervish, who had made his home in the hollow of a large plane-tree,
in front of which he sat, surrounded by a small fence of
stakes only a foot or so in height. Around him, but not venturing
within the fence, were a number of gaunt, half-starved
dogs, who prowled about him in hopes of having an occasional
morsel of food thrown to them. Solitary as he was, and scanty
as must have been the nourishment which he could afford to
them, the innate trustfulness of the dog-nature induced them
to attach themselves to human society of some sort, though their
master was one, and they were many&mdash;he was poor, and they
were hungry.</p>

<h2>THE WOLF.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Identity of the animal indisputable&mdash;its numbers, past and present&mdash;The Wolf
never mentioned directly&mdash;its general habits&mdash;References in Scripture&mdash;its
mingled ferocity and cowardice&mdash;its association into packs&mdash;The Wolf's bite&mdash;How

Wolf at Marsaba.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is no doubt that the Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Zeëb</i>, which occurs in
a few passages of the Old Testament, is rightly translated as
<span class="smcap">Wolf</span>, and signifies the same animal as is frequently mentioned
in the New Testament.</p>

<p>This fierce and dangerous animal was formerly very plentiful
in Palestine, but is now much less common, owing to the same
causes which have extirpated the lion from the country. It is a
rather remarkable fact, that in no passage of Holy Writ is the
Wolf directly mentioned. Its name is used as a symbol of a
fierce and treacherous enemy, but neither in the Old nor New
Testament does any sacred writer mention any act as performed
by the Wolf. We have already heard of the lion which attacked
Samson and was killed by him, of the lion which slew the disobedient
prophet, and of the lions which spared Daniel when
thrown into their den. We also read of the dogs which licked
Ahab's blood, and ate the body of Jezebel, also of the bears
which tore the mocking children.</p>

<p>But in no case is the Wolf mentioned, except in a metaphorical
sense; and this fact is the more remarkable, because the
animals were so numerous that they were very likely to have
exercised some influence on a history extending over such a
lengthened range of years, and limited to so small a portion of
the earth. Yet we never hear of the Wolf attacking any of the
personages mentioned in Scripture; and although we are told of
the exploit of David, who pursued a lion and a bear that had
taken a lamb out of his fold, we are never told of any similar
deed in connexion with the Wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="attack" id="attack"></a>
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="450" height="452" alt="attack" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WOLVES ATTACKING A FLOCK OF SHEEP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This animal was then what it is now. Seldom seen by day,
it lies hidden in its covert as long as the light lasts, and steals
out in search of prey in the evening. This custom of the Wolf
is mentioned in several passages of Holy Scripture, such as that
in Jer. v. 5, 6: "These have altogether broken the yoke, and
burst the bonds. Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay
them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them." In this
passage the reader will see that the rebellious Israelites are
compared to restive draught cattle which have broken away from
their harness and run loose, so that they are deprived of the
protection of their owners, and exposed to the fury of wild
beasts. A similar reference is made in Hab. i. 8: "Their horses
also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the
evening wolves." The same habit of the Wolf is alluded to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Zeph. iii. 3: "Her princes within her are roaring lions; her
judges are evening wolves."</p>

<p>Individually, the Wolf is rather a timid animal. It will avoid
a man rather than meet him. It prefers to steal upon its prey
and take it unawares, rather than to seize it openly and boldly.
It is ever suspicious of treachery, and is always imagining that a
trap is laid for it. Even the shallow device of a few yards of
rope trailing from any object, or a strip of cloth fluttering in the
breeze, is quite sufficient to keep the Wolf at bay for a considerable
time. This fact is well known to hunters, who are accustomed
to secure the body of a slain deer by simply tying a strip
of cloth to its horn. If taken in a trap of any kind, or even if
it fancies itself in an enclosure from which it can find no egress,
it loses all courage, and will submit to be killed without offering
the least resistance. It will occasionally endeavour to effect its
escape by feigning death, and has more than once been known to
succeed in this device.</p>

<p>But, collectively, the Wolf is one of the most dangerous
animals that can be found. Herding together in droves when
pressed by hunger, the wolves will openly hunt prey, performing
this task as perfectly as a pack of trained hounds. Full of wiles
themselves, they are craftily wise in anticipating the wiles of
the animals which they pursue; and even in full chase, while the
body of the pack is following on the footsteps of the flying
animal, one or two are detached on the flanks, so as to cut it off
if it should attempt to escape by doubling on its pursuers.</p>

<p>There is no animal which a herd of wolves will not attack,
and very few which they will not ultimately secure. Strength
avails nothing against the numbers of these savage foes, which
give no moment of rest, but incessantly assail their antagonist,
dashing by instinct at those parts of the body which can be
least protected, and lacerating with their peculiar short, snapping
bite. Should several of their number be killed or disabled, it
makes no difference to the wolves, except that a minute or two
are wasted in devouring their slain or wounded brethren, and
they only return to the attack the more excited by the taste of
blood. Swiftness of foot avails nothing against the tireless perseverance
of the wolves, who press on in their peculiar, long,
slinging gallop, and in the end are sure to tire out the swifter
footed but less enduring animal that flees before them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
stately buffalo is conquered by the ceaseless assaults of the
wolves; the bear has been forced to succumb to them, and the
fleet-footed stag finds his swift limbs powerless to escape the
pursuing band, and his branching horns unable to resist their
furious onset when once they overtake him.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="chasing" id="chasing"></a>
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="450" height="430" alt="chasing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WOLVES CHASING DEER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>That the Wolf is a special enemy to the sheep-fold is shown
in many parts of the Scriptures, both in the Old and New Testaments,
especially in the latter. In John x. 1-16, Jesus compares
himself to a good shepherd, who watches over the fold,
and, if the wolves should come to take the sheep, would rather
give up His life than they should succeed. But the false teachers
are compared to bad shepherds, hired for money, but having no
interest in the sheep, and who therefore will not expose themselves
to danger in defence of their charge.</p>

<p>This metaphor was far more effective in Palestine, and at that
time, than it is in this country and at the present day. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a><br /><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
land, the shepherd has no anxiety about the inroads of wild
beasts, but in Palestine one of his chief cares was to keep watch
at night lest the wolves should attack the fold, and to drive them
away himself in case they should do so. Therefore the shepherd's
life was one which involved no small danger as well as
anxiety, and the metaphor used by our Lord gains additional
force from the knowledge of this fact.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WOLF.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A similar metaphor is used when Jesus wished to express in
forcible terms the dangers to which the chosen seventy would
oft be subjected, and the impossibility that they should be able
to overcome the many perils with which they would be surrounded.
"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs
among wolves" (Luke x. 3).</p>

<p>Mr. Tristram several times met wolves while he was engaged
in his travels, and mostly saw solitary specimens. One such
encounter took place in the wilderness of Judah: "On my way
back, I met a fine solitary wolf, who watched me very coolly, at
the distance of sixty yards, while I drew my charge and dropped
a bullet down the barrel. Though I sent the ball into a rock
between his legs as he stood looking at me in the wady, he was
not sufficiently alarmed to do more than move on a little more
quickly, ever and anon turning to look at me, while gradually
increasing his distance. Darkness compelled me to desist from
the chase, when he quietly turned and followed me at a respectful
distance. He was a magnificent animal, larger than any
European wolf, and of a much lighter colour."</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the character of the animal
will appreciate the truthfulness of this description. The cautious
prowl at a distance, the slow trot away when he fancied he
might be attacked, the reverted look, and the final turning back
and following at a respectful distance, are all characteristic traits
of the Wolf, no matter to what species it may belong, nor what
country it may inhabit.</p>

<p>On another occasion, while riding in the open plain of Gennesaret,
the horse leaped over the bank of a little ditch, barely
three feet in depth. After the horse had passed, and not until
then, a Wolf started out of the ditch, literally from under the
horses hoofs, and ran off. The animal had been crouching under
the little bank, evidently watching for some cows and calves
which were grazing at a short distance, under the charge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Bedouin boy. The same author
mentions that one of the monks
belonging to the monastery at
Marsaba had contrived to render
a Wolf almost tame. Every
evening at six o'clock the Wolf
came regularly across the ravine, ate a
piece of bread, and then went back again.
With the peculiar jealousy of all tamed animals, the Wolf would
not suffer any of his companions to partake of his good fortune.
Several of them would sometimes accompany him, but as soon as they
came under the wall of the monastery he always drove them away.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Palestine say that the Wolves of that country
hunt singly, or at most in little packs of few in number. Still
they dread the animal exceedingly on account of the damage it
inflicts upon their flocks of sheep and goats.</p>

<h2>THE FOX OR JACKAL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The two animals comprehended under one name&mdash;The Jackal&mdash;its numbers in

<p>There are several passages in the Old Testament in which the
word Fox occurs, and it is almost certain that the Hebrew word
<i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Shuâl</i>, which is rendered in our translation as Fox, is used rather
loosely, and refers in some places to the Jackal, and in others to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the Fox. We will first take those passages in which the former
rendering of the word is evidently the right one, and will begin
by examining those characteristics of the animal which afford
grounds for such an assertion.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="jackals" id="jackals"></a>
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="450" height="457" alt="jackals" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">FOXES OR JACKALS DEVOURING THE CARCASE OF A GOAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Even at the present time, the Jackal is extremely plentiful in
Palestine; and as the numbers of wild beasts have much decreased
in modern days, the animals must have been even more
numerous than they are at present. It is an essentially nocturnal
and gregarious animal. During the whole of the day the
Jackals lie concealed in their holes or hiding-places, which are
usually cavities in the rocks, in tombs, or among ruins. At
nightfall they issue from their dens, and form themselves into
packs, often consisting of several hundred individuals, and prowl
about in search of food. Carrion of various kinds forms their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
chief subsistence, and they perform in the country much the
same task as is fulfilled by the dogs in the cities.</p>

<p>If any animal should be killed, or even severely wounded, the
Jackals are sure to find it out and to devour it before the daybreak.
They will scent out the track of the hunter, and feed
upon the offal of the beasts which he has slain. If the body of
a human being were to be left on the ground, the Jackals would
certainly leave but little traces of it; and in the olden times of
warfare, they must have held high revelry in the battle-field
after the armies had retired. It is to this propensity of the
Jackal that David refers&mdash;himself a man of war, who had
fought on many a battle-field, and must have seen the carcases
of the slain mangled by these nocturnal prowlers: "Those that
seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the
earth. They shall fall by the sword; they shall be a portion for
foxes" (Ps. lxiii. 9, 10). Being wild beasts, afraid of man, and
too cowardly to attack him even when rendered furious by
hunger, and powerful by force of numbers, they keep aloof from
towns and cities, and live in the uninhabited parts of the
country. Therefore the prophet Jeremiah, in his Book of
Lamentations, makes use of the following forcible image, when
deploring the pitiful state into which Judæa had fallen: "For
this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim:
because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
walk upon it" (Lam. v. 17). And Ezekiel makes use of a similar
image: "O Israel, thy prophets are like foxes in the desert."</p>

<p>But, by far the most important passage in which the Fox
is mentioned, is that wherein is recorded the grotesque
vengeance of Samson upon the Philistines: "And Samson went
and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned
tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.
And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
standing com of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks
and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives"
(Judges xv. 4, 5). Now, as this is one of the passages of Holy Writ
to which great objections have been taken, it will be as well to
examine these objections, and see whether they have any real
force. The first of these objections is, that the number of foxes
is far too great to have been caught at one time, and to this
objection two answers have been given. The first answer is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they need not have been caught at once, but by degrees, and
kept until wanted. But the general tenor of the narrative is
undoubtedly in favour of the supposition that this act of Samson
was unpremeditated, and that it was carried into operation at
once, before his anger had cooled. The second answer is, that
the requisite number of Foxes might have been miraculously
sent to Samson for this special purpose. This theory is really
so foolish and utterly untenable, that I only mention it because
it has been put forward. It fails on two grounds: the first
being that a miracle would hardly have been wrought to enable
Samson to revenge himself in so cruel and unjustifiable a
manner; and the second, that there was not the least necessity
for any miracle at all.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A FEAST IN PROSPECT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If we put out of our minds the idea of the English Fox, an
animal comparatively scarce in this country, and solitary in its
habits, and substitute the extremely plentiful and gregarious
Jackal, wandering in troops by night, and easily decoyed by
hunger into a trap, we shall see that double the number might
have been taken, if needful. Moreover, it is not to be imagined
that Samson caught them all with his own hand. He was at
the head of his people, and had many subordinates at his
command, so that a large number of hunters might have been
employed simultaneously in the capture. In corroboration of
this point, I insert an extremely valuable extract from Signor
Pierotti's work, in which he makes reference to this very portion
of the sacred history:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is still very abundant near Gaza, Askalon, Ashdod, Ekron,
and Ramleh. I have frequently met with it during my wanderings
by night, and on one occasion had an excellent opportunity
of appreciating their number and their noise.</p>

<p>"One evening in the month of January, while it was raining
a perfect deluge, I was obliged, owing to the dangerous illness
of a friend, to return from Jerusalem to Jaffa. The depth
of snow on the road over a great part of the mountain, the
clayey mud in the plain, and the darkness of the night, prevented
my advancing quickly; so that about half-past three in
the morning I arrived on the bank of a small torrent, about
half an hour's journey to the east of Ramleh. I wished to
cross: my horse at first refused, but, on my spurring it, advanced
and at once sank up to the breast, followed of course by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a><br /><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
my legs, thus teaching me to respect the instinct of an Arab
horse for the future.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 325px;"><a name="secured" id="secured"></a>
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="325" height="600" alt="secured" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A FEAST SECURED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"There I stuck, without the possibility of escape, and consoled
my horse and myself with some provisions that I had in my
saddle-bags, shouting and singing at intervals, in the hope of
obtaining succour, and of preventing accidents, as I knew that
the year before a mule in the same position had been mistaken
for a wild beast, and killed. The darkness was profound, and
the wind very high; but, happily, it was not cold; for the only
things attracted by my calls were numbers of jackals, who
remained at a certain distance from me, and responded to my
cries, especially when I tried to imitate them, as though they
took me for their music-master.</p>

<p>"About five o'clock, one of the guards of the English consulate
at Jerusalem came from Ramleh and discovered my state.
He charitably returned thither, and brought some men, who
extricated me and my horse from our unpleasant bath, which, as
may be supposed, was not beneficial to our legs.</p>

<p>"During this most uncomfortable night, I had good opportunity
of ascertaining that, if another Samson had wished to
burn again the crops in the country of the Philistines, he would
have had no difficulty in finding more than three hundred
jackals, and catching as many as he wanted in springs, traps,
or pitfalls. (See Ps. cxl. 5.)"</p>

<p>The reader will now see that there was not the least difficulty
in procuring the requisite number of animals, and that consequently
the first objection to the truth of the story is disposed
of.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to the second objection, which is, that if
the animals were tied tail to tail, they would remain on or near
the same spot, because they would pull in different directions,
and that, rather than run about, they would turn round and
fight each other. Now, in the first place, we are nowhere told
that the tails of the foxes, or jackals, were placed in contact with
each other, and it is probable that some little space was left
between them. That animals so tied would not run in a straight
line is evident enough, and this was exactly the effect which
Samson wished to produce. Had they been at liberty, and the
fiery brand fastened to their tails, they would have run straight
to their dens, and produced but little effect. But their captor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with cruel ingenuity, had foreseen this contingency, and, by
the method of securing them which he adopted, forced them to
pursue a devious course, each animal trying to escape from the
dreaded firebrand, and struggling in vain endeavours to drag its
companion towards its own particular den.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="trespasser" id="trespasser"></a>
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="600" height="313" alt="trespasser" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A TRESPASSER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All wild animals have an instinctive dread of fire; and there
is none, not even the fierce and courageous lion, that dares enter
within the glare of the bivouac fire. A lion has even been
struck in the face with a burning brand, and has not ventured
to attack the man that wielded so dreadful a weapon. Consequently
it may be imagined that the unfortunate animals that
were used by Samson for his vindictive purpose, must have been
filled with terror at the burning brands which they dragged after
them, and the blaze of the fire which was kindled wherever
they went. They would have no leisure to fight, and would only
think of escaping from the dread and unintelligible enemy which
pursued them.</p>

<p>When a prairie takes fire, all the wild inhabitants flee in
terror, and never think of attacking each other, so that the bear,
the wolf, the cougar, the deer, and the wild swine, may all be
seen huddled together, their natural antagonism quelled in the
presence of a common foe. So it must have been with the
miserable animals which were made the unconscious instruments
of destruction. That they would stand still when a burning
brand was between them, and when flames sprang up around
them, is absurd. That they would pull in exactly opposite
directions with precisely balanced force is equally improbable,
and it is therefore evident that they would pursue a devious
path, the stronger of the two dragging the weaker, but being
jerked out of a straight course and impeded by the resistance
which it would offer. That they would stand on the same spot
and fight has been shown to be contrary to the custom of
animals under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that every objection not only falls to the
ground, but carries its own refutation, thus vindicating this
episode in sacred history, and showing, that not only were the
circumstances possible, but that they were highly probable. Of
course every one of the wretched animals must have been ultimately
burned to death, after suffering a prolonged torture from
the firebrand that was attached to it. Such a consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
would, however, have had no effect for deterring Samson from
employing them. The Orientals are never sparing of pain, even
when inflicted upon human beings, and in too many cases they
seem utterly unable even to comprehend the cruelty of which
they are guilty. And Samson was by no means a favourable
specimen of his countrymen. He was the very incarnation of
strength, but was as morally weak as he was corporeally powerful;
and to that weakness he owed his fall. Neither does he
seem to possess the least trace of forbearance any more than of
self-control, but he yields to his own undisciplined nature, places
himself, and through him the whole Israelitish nation, in
jeopardy, and then, with a grim humour, scatters destruction on
every side in revenge for the troubles which he has brought
upon himself by his own acts.</p>

<h2>THE HYÆNA.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Hyæna not mentioned by name, but evidently alluded to&mdash;Signification of
the word Zabua&mdash;Translated in the Septuagint as Hyæna&mdash;A scene described
by the prophet Isaiah&mdash;The Hyæna plentiful in Palestine at the present day&mdash;its
well-known cowardice and fear of man&mdash;The uses of the Hyæna and the
services which it renders&mdash;The particular species of Hyæna&mdash;The Hyæna in
the burial-grounds&mdash;Hunting the Hyæna&mdash;Curious superstition respecting the
talismanic properties of its skin&mdash;Precautions adopted in flaying it&mdash;Popular
legends of the Hyæna and its magical powers&mdash;The cavern home of the Hyæna&mdash;The
valley of Zeboim.</p></blockquote>


<p>Although in our version of the Scriptures the Hyæna is not
mentioned by that name, there are two passages in the Old
Testament which evidently refer to that animal, and therefore it
is described in these pages. If the reader will refer to the
prophet Jeremiah, xii. 7-9, he will find these words: "I
have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have
given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her
enemies. Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it
crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. Mine heritage
is unto me as a speckled bird; the birds round about are against
her: come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to
devour." Now, the word <em>zabua</em> signifies something that is
streaked, and in the Authorized Version it is rendered as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
speckled bird. But in the Septuagint it is rendered as Hyæna,
and this translation is thought by many critical writers to be
the true one. It is certain that the word <em>zabua</em> is one of the
four names by which the Talmudical writers mention the Hyæna,
when treating of its character; and it is equally certain that
such a rendering makes the passage more forcible, and is in
perfect accordance with the habits of predacious animals.</p>

<p>The whole scene which the Prophet thus describes was evidently
familiar to him. First, we have the image of a deserted
country, allowed to be overrun with wild beasts. Then we have
the lion, which has struck down its prey, roaring with exultation,
and defying any adversary to take it from him. Then, the lion
having eaten his fill and gone away, we have the Hyænas, vultures,
and other carrion-eating creatures, assembling around the
carcase, and hastening to devour it. This is a scene which has
been witnessed by many hunters who have pursued their sport
in lands where lions, hyænas, and vultures are found; and all
these creatures were inhabitants of Palestine at the time when
Jeremiah wrote.</p>

<p>At the present day, the Hyæna is still plentiful in Palestine,
though in the course of the last few years its numbers have
sensibly diminished. The solitary traveller, when passing by
night from one town to another, often falls in with the Hyæna,
but need suffer no fear, as it will not attack a human being, and
prefers to slink out of his way. But dead, and dying, or
wounded animals are the objects for which it searches; and
when it finds them, it devours the whole of its prey. The lion
will strike down an antelope, an ox, or a goat&mdash;will tear off its
flesh with its long fangs, and lick the bones with its rough
tongue until they are quite cleaned. The wolves and jackals
will follow the lion, and eat every soft portion of the dead
animal, while the vultures will fight with them for the coveted
morsels. But the Hyæna is a more accomplished scavenger
than lion, wolf, jackal, or vulture; for it will eat the very bones
themselves, its tremendously-powerful jaws and firmly-set teeth
enabling it to crush even the leg-bone of an ox, and its unparalleled
digestive powers enabling it to assimilate the sharp
and hard fragments which would kill any creature not constituted
like itself.</p>

<p>In a wild, or even a partially-inhabited country, the Hyæna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a><br /><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is, therefore, a most useful animal. It may occasionally kill a
crippled or weakly ox, and sometimes carry off a sheep; but,
even in that case, no very great harm is done, for it does not
meddle with any animal that can resist. But these few delinquencies
are more than compensated by the great services which
it renders as scavenger, consuming those substances which even
the lion cannot eat, and thus acting as a scavenger in removing
objects which would be offensive to sight and injurious to
health.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 322px;"><a name="robbed" id="robbed"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">LEOPARD ROBBED OF ITS PREY BY HYÆNAS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The species which is mentioned in the Scriptures is the Striped
Hyæna (<em>Hyæna striata</em>); but the habits of all the species are
almost exactly similar. We are told by travellers of certain
towns in different parts of Africa which would be unendurable
but for the Hyænas. With the disregard for human life which
prevails throughout all savage portions of that country, the rulers
of these towns order executions almost daily, the bodies of the
victims being allowed to lie where they happened to fall. No
one chooses to touch them, lest they should also be added to the
list of victims, and the decomposing bodies would soon cause a
pestilence but for the Hyænas, who assemble at night round
the bodies, and by the next morning have left scarcely a trace of
the murdered men.</p>

<p>Even in Palestine, and in the present day, the Hyæna will
endeavour to rifle the grave, and to drag out the interred corpse.
The bodies of the rich are buried in rocky caves, whose entrances
are closed with heavy stones, which the Hyæna cannot move;
but those of the poor, which are buried in the ground, must be
defended by stones heaped over them. Even when this precaution
is taken, the Hyæna will sometimes find out a weak
spot, drag out the body, and devour it.</p>

<p>In consequence of this propensity, the inhabitants have an
utter detestation of the animal. They catch it whenever they
can, in pitfalls or snares, using precisely the same means as were
employed two thousand years ago; or they hunt it to its den,
and then kill it, stripping off the hide, and carrying it about still
wet, receiving a small sum of money from those to whom they
show it. Afterwards the skin is dressed, by rubbing it with lime
and salt, and steeping it in the waters of the Dead Sea. It is then
made into sandals and leggings, which are thought to be powerful
charms, and to defend the wearer from the Hyæna's bite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>They always observe certain superstitious precautions in flaying
the dead animal. Believing that the scent of the flesh
would corrupt the air, they invariably take the carcase to the
leeward of the tents before they strip off the skin. Even in the
animal which has been kept for years in a cage, and has eaten
nothing but fresh meat, the odour is too powerful to be agreeable,
as I can testify from practical experience when dissecting a
Hyæna that had died in the Zoological Gardens; and it is evident
that the scent of an animal that has lived all its life on carrion
must be almost unbearable. The skin being removed, the carcase
is burnt, because the hunters think that by this process the
other Hyænas are prevented from finding the body of their
comrade, and either avenging its death or taking warning by
its fate.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 401px;"><a name="devouring" id="devouring"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Superstitions seem to be singularly prevalent concerning the
Hyæna. In Palestine, there is a prevalent idea that if a Hyæna
meets a solitary man at night, it can enchant him in such a
manner as to make him follow it through thickets and over
rocks, until he is quite exhausted, and falls an unresisting prey;
but that over two persons he has no such influence, and therefore
a solitary traveller is gravely advised to call for help as soon as
he sees a Hyæna, because the fascination of the beast would be
neutralized by the presence of a second person. So firmly is
this idea rooted in the minds of the inhabitants, that they will
never travel by night, unless they can find at least one companion
in their journey.</p>

<p>In Northern Africa there are many strange superstitions connected
with this animal, one of the most curious of which is
founded on its well-known cowardice. The Arabs fancy that
any weapon which has killed a Hyæna, whether it be gun,
sword, spear, or dagger, is thenceforth unfit to be used in warfare.
"Throw away that sword," said an Arab to a French
officer, who had killed a Hyæna, "it has slain the Hyæna, and it
will be treacherous to you."</p>

<p>At the present day, its numbers are not nearly so great in
Palestine as they used to be, and are decreasing annually. The
cause of this diminution lies, according to Signor Pierotti, more
in the destruction of forests than in the increase of population
and the use of fire-arms, though the two latter causes have
undoubtedly considerable influence.</p>

<p>There is a very interesting account by Mr. Tristram of the
haunt of these animals. While exploring the deserted quarries
of Es Sumrah, between Beth-arabah and Bethel, he came upon a
wonderful mass of hyænine relics. The quarries in which were
lying the half-hewn blocks, scored with the marks of wedges,
had evidently formed the resort of Hyænas for a long series of
years. "Vast heaps of bones of camels, oxen, and sheep had
been collected by these animals, in some places to the depth of
two or three feet, and on one spot I counted the skulls of seven
camels. There were no traces whatever of any human remains.
We had here a beautiful recent illustration of the mode of
foundation of the old bone caverns, so valuable to the geologist.
These bones must all have been brought in by the Hyænas, as
no camel or sheep could possibly have entered the caverns alive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
nor could any floods have washed them in. Near the entrance
where the water percolates, they were already forming a soft
breccia."</p>

<p>The second allusion to the Hyæna is made in 1 Sam. xiii. 18,
"Another company turned to the way of the border that looketh
to the Valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness," <em>i.e.</em> to the
Valley of Hyænas.</p>

<p>The colour of the Striped Hyæna varies according to its age.
When young, as is the case with many creatures, birds as well
as mammals, the stripes from which it derives its name are
much more strongly marked than in the adult specimen. The
general hue of the fur is a pale grey-brown, over which are
drawn a number of dark stripes, extending along the ribs and
across the limbs.</p>

<p>In the young animal these stripes are nearly twice as dark
and twice as wide as in the adult, and they likewise appear on
the face and on other parts of the body, whence they afterwards
vanish. The fur is always rough; and along the spine, and especially
over the neck and shoulders, it is developed into a kind
of mane, which gives a very fierce aspect to the animal. The
illustration shows a group of Hyænas coming to feed on the
relics of a dead animal. The jackals and vultures have eaten as
much of the flesh as they can manage, and the vultures are
sitting, gorged, round the stripped bones. The Hyænas are now
coming up to play their part as scavengers, and have already
begun to break up the bones in their crushing-mills of jaws.</p>

<h2>THE WEASEL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Difficulty of identifying the Weasel of Scripture&mdash;The Weasel of Palestine&mdash;Suggested
identity with the Ichneumon.</p></blockquote>


<p>The word Weasel occurs once in the Holy Scriptures, and
therefore it is necessary that the animal should be mentioned.
There is a great controversy respecting the identification of the
animal, inasmuch as there is nothing in the context which gives
the slightest indication of its appearance or habits.</p>

<p>The passage in question is that which prohibits the Weasel and
the mouse as unclean animals (see Lev. xi. 29). Now the word
which is here translated Weasel is <em>Choled</em>, or <em>Chol'd</em>; and, I
believe, never occurs again in the whole of the Old Testament.
Mr. W. Houghton conjectures that the Hebrew word Choled is
identical with the Arabic <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Chuld</i> and the Syriac <em>Chuldo</em>, both
words signifying a mole; and therefore infers that the unclean
animal in question is not a Weasel, but a kind of mole.</p>

<p>The Weasel does exist in Palestine, and seems to be as plentiful
there as in our own country. Indeed, the whole tribe of Weasels
is well represented, and the polecat is seen there as well as the
Weasel.</p>

<p>There is hardly any animal which, for its size, is so much dreaded
by the creatures on which it preys as the common Weasel.</p>

<p>Although its small proportions render a single Weasel an insignificant
opponent to man or dog, yet it can wage a sharp battle
even with such powerful foes, and refuses to yield except at the
last necessity.</p>

<p>The proportions of the Weasel are extremely small, a full-grown
male not exceeding ten inches in length. The color of its fur is
bright reddish-brown on the upper parts of the body, and the
under-portions are pure white. The audacity and courage of this
little animal are really remarkable. It seems to hold every being
except itself in the most sovereign contempt, and, to all appearances,
is as ready to match itself against a man as against a mouse.</p>

<p>It is a terrible foe to many of the smaller animals, such as rats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and mice, and performs a really good service to the farmer in destroying
many of these farmyard pests. The Weasel is specially
dreaded by rats and mice, because there is no hole through which
they can pass that will not also admit the passage of their enemy;
and, as the Weasel is most persevering and determined in pursuit,
it seldom happens that rats or mice escape when their little foe has
set itself fairly on their track.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="weasels" id="weasels"></a>
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="weasels" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WEASELS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Not only does the Weasel pursue its prey through the windings
of the burrows, but it will even cross water in the chase. When
it has at last reached its victim, it leaps upon the devoted creature
and endeavours to fix its teeth in the back of the neck, where it
retains its deadly hold in spite of every struggle on the part of the
wounded animal. If the attack be rightly made and the animal a
small one, the Weasel can drive its teeth into the brain and cause
instantaneous death.</p>

<p>The Weasel is very fond of eggs, and young birds of all kinds.
It is said that an egg that has been broken by a Weasel, can always
be recognized, by the peculiar mode which the little creature employs
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Instead of breaking the egg to pieces or biting a large hole in
the shell, the Weasel contents itself with making quite a small
aperture at one end, through which it abstracts the liquid contents.</p>

<p>A curious example of the courage of the Weasel, is related by a
gentleman who while crossing a field at dusk, saw an owl pounce
upon some object on the ground, and carry it in the air.</p>

<p>In a short time the bird showed signs of distress, trying to free
itself from some annoying object by means of its talons, and flapping
about in a very bewildered manner.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the owl fell dead to the earth; and when the
spectator of the aërial combat approached, a weasel ran away from
the dead body of the bird, itself being apparently uninjured. On
examination of the owl's body, it was found that the Weasel, which
had been marked out for the owl's repast, had in its turn become
the assailant, and had attacked the unprotected parts which lie
beneath the wings. A considerable wound had been made in that
spot, and the large blood-vessels torn through.</p>

<h2>THE BADGER.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Difficulty in identifying the <em>Tachash</em> of Scripture&mdash;References to "Badgers'
skins"&mdash;The Dugong thought to be the Badger&mdash;The Bedouin sandals&mdash;Nature
of the materials for the Tabernacle&mdash;Habits of the Badger&mdash;The species
found in Palestine&mdash;Uses of the Badgers' skins&mdash;Looseness of zoological
terms.</p></blockquote>


<p>Until very lately, there was much difficulty in ascertaining
whether the word <em>Tachash</em> has been rightly translated as
Badger. It occurs in several parts of the Scriptures, and almost
invariably is used in relation to a skin or fur of some sort. We
will first examine the passages in which the Badger is mentioned,
and then proceed to identify the animal.</p>

<p>Nearly all the references to the Badger occur in the book of
Exodus, and form part of the directions for constructing the
Tabernacle and its contents. The first notice of the word occurs
in Exodus xxv. 5, where the people of Israel are ordered to
bring their offerings for the sanctuary, among which offerings are
gold, silver, and brass, blue, purple, and scarlet, fine linen, goats'
hair, rams' skins dyed red, badgers' skins, and shittim wood&mdash;all
these to be used in the construction of the Tabernacle. Then a
little farther on, in chapter xxvi. 14, we find one of the special
uses to which the badgers' skins were to be put, namely, to make
the outer covering or roof of the tabernacle. Another use for
the badgers' skins was to form an outer covering for the ark, table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of shewbread, and other furniture of the Tabernacle, when the
people were on the march.</p>

<p>In all these cases the badger-skin is used as a covering to
defend a building or costly furniture, but there is one example
where it is employed for a different purpose. This passage
occurs in the book of Ezekiel, chapter xvi. 10. The prophet is
speaking of Jerusalem under the image of a woman, and uses
these words, "I anointed thee with oil; I clothed thee also with
broidered work, and shod thee with badger's skin, and I girded
thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk. I
decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
hands, and a chain upon thy neck, and I put a jewel on thy
forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon
thine head."</p>

<p>So we have here the fact, that the same material which was
used for the covering of the Tabernacle, and of the sacred furniture,
could also be used for the manufacture of shoes. This
passage is the more valuable because of an inference which may
be drawn from it. The reader will see that the badger-skin,
whatever it may have been, must have been something of considerable
value, and therefore, in all probability, something of
much rarity.</p>

<p>In the present instance, it is classed with the most luxurious
robes that were known in those days, and it is worthy of special
mention among the bracelet, earrings, necklace, and coronal with
which the symbolized city was adorned. If the reader will now
refer to the passage in which the children of Israel were commanded
to bring their offerings, he will see that in those cases
also the badger-skins were ranked with the costliest articles of
apparel that could be found, and had evidently been brought
from Egypt, the peculiar home of all the arts; together with the
vast quantity of gold and jewels which were used for the same
sacred purpose.</p>

<p>Now we find that the badger-skins in question must possess
three qualities: they must be costly, they must be capable of
forming a defence against the weather, and they must be strong
enough to be employed in the manufacture of shoes. If we
accept the word Tachash as signifying a Badger, we shall find
that these conditions have been fulfilled.</p>

<p>But many commentators have thought that badger-skins could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
not have been procured in sufficient numbers for the purpose,
and have therefore conjectured that some other animal must be
signified by the word Tachash.</p>

<p>A species of dugong (<em>Halicore hemprichii</em>) is the animal that
has been selected as the Badger of the Scriptures. It is one of
the marine mammalia, and always lives near the shore, where it
can find the various algæ on which it feeds. It is a gregarious
animal, and, as it frequently ascends rivers for some distance, it
may be captured in sufficient numbers to make both its flesh
and skin useful. Moreover, it is of considerable size, fourteen
or fifteen feet in length being its usual dimensions, so that a
comparatively small number of the skins would be required for
the covering of the Tabernacle.</p>

<p>That shoes can be made of it is evident from the fact that at
the present day shoes, or rather sandals, are made from its hide,
and are commonly used by the Bedouins. But the very qualities
and peculiarities which render it a fit material for the sandal of a
half-naked Bedouin Arab, who has to walk continually over hard,
hot, sandy, and rough ground, would surely make it unsuitable for
the delicate shoes worn by a woman of rank who spends her
time in the house, and the rest of whose clothing is of fine linen
and silk, embroidered with gold and jewels. In our own country,
the hobnailed shoes of the ploughman and the slight shoe of a
lady are made of very different materials, and it is reasonable
to conjecture that such was the case when the passage in question
was written.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Robinson, who admits that the hide of the dugong
could hardly have been used as the material for a lady's shoe,
thinks that it would have answered very well for the roof of the
Tabernacle, because it was large, clumsy, and coarse. It seems
strange that he did not also perceive that the two latter qualities
would completely disqualify such skins for that service. Everything
clumsy and coarse was studiously prohibited, and nothing
but the very best was considered fit for the Tabernacle of the
Lord. By special revelation, Moses was instructed to procure,
not merely the ordinary timber of the country for the framework&mdash;not
only the fabrics which would keep out rain and
wind&mdash;not simply the metals in common use, from which
to make the lamps and other furniture&mdash;not the ordinary
oils for supplying the lamps; but, on the contrary, the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
linen, the most elaborate embroidery, the rarest woods, the
purest gold, the costliest gems, were demanded, and nothing
common or inferior was accepted. The commonest material
that was permitted was the long, soft fleece of rams' wool;
but, even in that case, the wool had to be dyed of the regal
scarlet&mdash;a dye so rare and so costly that none but the
wealthiest rulers could use it. Even the very oil that burned
in the lamps must be the purest olive-oil, prepared expressly
for that purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="badgers" id="badgers"></a>
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="badgers" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BADGERS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The very fact, therefore, that any article was plentiful and
could easily be obtained, would be a proof that such article was
not used for so sacred a purpose; while it is impossible that
anything coarse and clumsy could have been accepted for the
construction of that Tabernacle within which the Shekinah ever
burned over the Mercy-seat&mdash;over which the cloud rested by
day, and the fire shone by night, visible external proofs of the
Divine glory within.</p>

<p>We therefore dismiss from our minds the possibility of accepting
any material for it which was not exceptionably valuable,
and which would be employed in the uses of ordinary life. The
great object of the minutely-elaborate directions which were
given through Moses to the Israelites was evidently to keep
continually before their eyes the great truth that they owed all
to God, and that their costliest offerings were but acknowledgments
of their dependence.</p>

<p>We will now presume that the Tachash of the Pentateuch and
Ezekiel is really the animal which we know by the name of
Badger. It exists throughout the whole of the district traversed
by the Israelites, though it is not very plentiful, nor is it easily
taken. Had such been the case, its fur would not have been
employed in the service of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>It is nocturnal in its habits, and very seldom is seen during
the hours of daylight, so that it cannot be captured by chase. It
is not gregarious, so that it cannot be taken in great numbers, as
is the case with certain wild animals which have been thought
to be the Tachash of Scripture. It is not a careless animal, so
that it cannot be captured or killed without the exercise of considerable
ingenuity, and the expenditure of much time and
trouble. It is one of the burrowing animals, digging for itself
a deep subterranean home, and always ready whenever it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a><br /><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
alarmed to escape into the dark recesses of its dwelling, from
which it can scarcely be dislodged. It is not a large animal, so
that a considerable number of skins would be required in order
to make a covering which should overlap a structure forty-five
feet in length and fifteen in breadth. Were it a solitary animal,
there might be a difficulty in procuring a sufficient number of
skins. But it is partly gregarious in its habits, living together
in small families, seven or eight being sometimes found to inhabit
a single dwelling-place. It is, therefore, sufficiently rare to make
its skin valuable, and sufficiently plentiful to furnish the requisite
number of skins. All these facts tend to show that the cost of
such a covering must have been very great, even though it was
the outermost, and, consequently, the least valuable of the four.
It has been suggested that these skins were only used to lay over
the lines where the different sets of coverings overlapped each
other, and that, in consequence, they need not have been very
numerous.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="supposed" id="supposed"></a>
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="600" height="370" alt="supposed" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SUPPOSED FORM AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABERNACLE, CAMP, ETC.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But we find that these same skins, which were evidently those
which formed the external roof, were used, when the Tabernacle
was taken down, for the purpose of forming distinct coverings
for the ark of the testimony, the table of shewbread, the seven-branched
candlestick, the golden altar, the various vessels used in
the ministrations, and lastly, the altar of sacrifice itself. Thus,
when we recollect the dimensions of the ark, the table, the candlestick,
and the two altars, we shall see that, in order to make
separate covers for them, a quantity of material would be used
which would be amply sufficient to cover the whole roof of the
Tabernacle, even if it had, as was most probably the case, a ridged,
and not a flat roof.</p>

<p>We now come to our next point, namely, the aptitude of the
Badger's skin to resist weather. Any one who has handled the
skin of the Badger will acknowledge that a better material could
hardly be found. The fur is long, thick, and, though light, is
moderately stiff, the hairs falling over each other in such a
manner as to throw off rain or snow as off a penthouse. And,
as to the third point, namely, its possible use as a material for the
manufacture of shoes, we may call to mind that the skin of the
Badger is proverbially tough, and that this very quality has
caused the animal to be subjected to most cruel treatment by a
class of sporting men which is now almost extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The Septuagint gives little assistance in determining the precise
nature of the Tachash, and rather seems to consider the word as
expressive of the colour with which the fur was dyed than that of
the animal from which it was taken. Still, it must be remembered
that not only are zoological terms used very loosely in the
Scriptures, but that in Hebrew, as in all other languages, the
same combination of letters often expresses two different ideas,
so that the word Tachash may equally signify a colour and an
animal. Moreover, it has been well pointed out that the repeated
use of the word in the plural number shows that it cannot
refer to colour; while its almost invariable combination with
the Hebrew word that signifies a skin implies that it does not
refer to colour, but to an animal.</p>

<p>What that animal may be, is, as I have already mentioned,
conjectural. But, as the authorized translation renders the word
as Badger, and as this reading fulfils the conditions necessary to
its identification, and as no other reading does fulfil them, we
cannot be very far wrong if we accept that translation as the
correct one, and assume the Tachash of the Scriptures to be the
animal which we call by the name of Badger.</p>

<h2>THE BEAR.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Syrian Bear&mdash;Identity of the Hebrew and Arabic titles&mdash;Its colour variable

seen&mdash;Reason for their diminution&mdash;Present localities of the Bear, and its

from the time of Samuel to that of St. John.</p></blockquote>


<p>Whatever doubt may exist as to the precise identity of
various animals mentioned in the Scriptures, there is none whatever
as to the creature which is frequently alluded to under the
name of Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hebrew word is <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Dôb</i>, and it is a remarkable fact that the
name of this animal in the Arabic language is almost identical
with the Hebrew term, namely, <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Dubh</i>. The peculiar species of
Bear which inhabits Palestine is the Syrian Bear (<em>Ursus
Isabellinus</em>), and, though it has been variously described by
different eye-witnesses, there is no doubt that the same species
was seen by them all. As is the case with many animals, the
Syrian Bear changes its colour as it grows older. When a cub, it is
of a darkish brown, which becomes a light brown as it approaches
maturity. But, when it has attained its full growth, it becomes
cream-coloured, and each succeeding year seems to lighten its
coat, so that a very old Bear is nearly as white as its relative of
the Arctic regions. Travellers, therefore, who have met the
younger specimens, have described them as brown in hue, while
those who have seen more aged individuals have stated that
the colour of the Syrian Bear is white.</p>

<p>Owing to the destruction of forests, the Bear, which is essentially
a lover of the woods, has decreased considerably in number. Yet,
even at the present time, specimens may be seen by the watchful
traveller, mostly about the range of Lebanon, but sometimes at
a considerable distance from that locality. Mr. Tristram, for
example, saw it close to the Lake of Gennesaret. "We never
met with so many wild animals as on one of those days. First
of all, a wild boar got out of some scrub close to us, as we were
ascending the valley. Then a deer was started below, ran up
the cliff, and wound along the ledge, passing close to us. Then
a large ichneumon almost crossed my feet and ran into a cleft;
and, while endeavouring to trace him, I was amazed to see a
brown Syrian Bear clumsily but rapidly clamber down the
rocks and cross the ravine. He was, however, far too cautious
to get within hailing distance of any of the riflemen."</p>

<p>The same author mentions that some of the chief strongholds
of this Bear are certain clefts in the face of a precipitous chasm
through which the river Leontes flows. This river runs into the
sea a few miles northward of Tyre, and assists in carrying off the
melted snows from the Lebanon range of mountains. His
description is so picturesque, that it must be given in his own
words. "The channel, though a thousand feet deep, was so
narrow that the opposite ridge was within gunshot. Looking
down the giddy abyss, we could see the cliff on our side partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
covered with myrtle, bay, and caper hanging from the fissures,
while the opposite side was perforated with many shallow caves,
the inaccessible eyries of vultures, eagles, and lanner falcons, which
were sailing in multitudes around. The lower part had many
ledges clad with shrubs, the strongholds of the Syrian Bear,
though inaccessible even to goats. Far beneath dashed the
milk-white river, a silver line in a ruby setting of oleanders,
roaring doubtless fiercely, but too distant to be heard at the
height on which we stood. This <em>cleft</em> of the Leontes was the only
true Alpine scenery we had met with in Palestine, and in any
country, and amidst any mountains, it would attract admiration."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="descending" id="descending"></a>
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="descending" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BEARS DESCENDING THE MOUNTAINS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On those elevated spots the Bear loves to dwell, and throughout
the summer-time generally remains in such localities. For the
Bear is one of the omnivorous animals, and is able to feed on
vegetable as well as animal substances, preferring the former
when they can be found. There is nothing that a Bear likes better
than strawberries and similar fruits, among which it will revel
throughout the whole fruit season, daintily picking the ripest
berries, and becoming wonderfully fat by the constant banquet.
Sometimes, when the fruits fail, it makes incursions among the
cultivated grounds, and is noted for the ravages which it makes
among a sort of vetch which is much grown in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>But during the colder months of the year the Bear changes
its diet, and becomes carnivorous. Sometimes it contents itself
with the various wild animals which it can secure, but sometimes
it descends to the lower plains, and seizes upon the goats
and sheep in their pastures. This habit is referred to by David,
in his well-known speech to Saul, when the king was trying to
dissuade him from matching himself against the gigantic
Philistine. "And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go
against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a
youth, and he a man of war from his youth.... Thy servant
kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion and a bear, and
took a lamb out of the flock: and I went out after him, and
smote him, and delivered it out of his hand; and when he arose
against me, I caught him by the beard, and smote him, and slew
him. Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God."&mdash;1 Sam. xvii. 33-36.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Though not generally apt to attack mankind, it will do so if
first attacked, and then becomes a most dangerous enemy. See,
for example, that most graphic passage in the book of the
prophet Amos, whose business as a herdsman must have made
him conversant with the habits, not only of the flocks and herds
which he kept, but of the wild beasts which might devour
them:&mdash;"Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to
what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and
not light. As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met
him; or went into a house, and leaned his hand on the wall,
and a serpent bit him." (v. 19.)</p>

<p>Another reference to the dangerous character of the Bear is
made in 2 Kings ii. 23, 24, in which is recorded that two she-bears
came out of the wood near Bethel, and killed forty-two of
the children that mocked at Elisha.</p>

<p>As the Bear is not swift of foot, but rather clumsy in its
movements, it cannot hope to take the nimbler animals in open
chase. It prefers to lie in wait for them in the bushes, and to
strike them down with a sudden blow of its paw, a terrible
weapon, which it can wield as effectively as the lion uses its
claws. An allusion to this habit is made in the Lamentations
of Jeremiah (iii. 10), "He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,
and as a lion in secret places."</p>

<p>Harmless to man as it generally is, there are occasions on
which it becomes a terrible and relentless foe, not seeking to
avoid his presence, but even searching for him, and attacking
him as soon as seen. In the proper season of the year, hunters,
or those who are travelling through those parts of the country
infested by the Bear, will sometimes find the cubs, generally
two in number, their mother having left them in the den while
she has gone to search for food. Although they would not
venture to take the initiative in an attack upon either of the
parents, they are glad of an opportunity which enables them to
destroy one or two Bears without danger to themselves. The
young Bears are easily killed or carried off, because at a very
early age they are as confident as they are weak, and do not try
to escape when they see the hunters approaching.</p>

<p>The only danger lies in the possibility that their deed may
be discovered by the mother before they can escape from the
locality, and, if she should happen to return while the robbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
are still in the neighbourhood, a severe conflict is sure to follow.
At any time an angry Bear is a terrible antagonist, especially if
it be wounded with sufficient severity to cause pain, and not
severely enough to cripple its movements. But, when to this
easily-roused ferocity is added the fury of maternal feelings, it
may be imagined that the hunters have good reason to fear its
attack.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SEEKING AN OUTLOOK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To all animals that rear their young is given a sublime and
almost supernatural courage in defending their offspring, and
from the lioness, that charges a host of armed men when her
cubs are in danger, to the hen, which defies the soaring kite or
prowling fox, or to the spider, that will give up her life rather
than abandon her yet unhatched brood, the same self-sacrificing
spirit actuates them all. Most terrible therefore is the wrath
of a creature which possesses, as is the case of the Bear, the
strongest maternal affections, added to great size, tremendous
weapons, and gigantic strength. That the sight of a Bear
bereaved of her young was well known to both writers and
contemporary readers of the Old Testament, is evident from
the fact that it is mentioned by several writers, and always
as a familiar illustration of furious anger. See for example
2 Sam. xvii. 8, when Hushai is dissuading Absalom from following
the cautious counsel of Ahithophel, "For thou knowest
thy father and his men, that they be mighty men of war, and
they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps
in the field." Solomon also, in the Proverbs (xvii. 12), uses
the same image, "Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
rather than a fool in his folly."</p>

<p>When the Bear fights, it delivers rapid strokes with its armed
paw, tearing and rending away everything that it strikes. A
blow from a bear's paw has been several times known to strip
the entire skin, together with the hair, from a man's head, and,
when fighting with dogs, to tear its enemies open as if each
claw were a chisel.</p>

<p>Bears are capable of erecting themselves on their hinder limbs,
and of supporting themselves in an upright position with the greatest
ease. When attacked in close combat, they have a habit of
rearing themselves upon their hinder feet&mdash;a position which enables
them to deliver with the greatest effect the terrific blows with their
fore paws, upon which they chiefly rely in defending themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>With fearful ingenuity, the Bear, when engaged with a human
foe, directs its attack upon the head of its antagonist, and, as previously
stated, has been known to strike off the entire scalp with
a single blow.</p>

</div>

<p>A hunter who had the misfortune to be struck down by a Bear&mdash;and
the singular good fortune to afterwards escape from it&mdash;says,
that when he was lying on the ground at the mercy of the angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
beast, the animal, after biting him upon the arms and legs, deliberately
settled itself upon his head and began to scarify it in the
fiercest manner, leaving wounds eight and nine inches in length.</p>

<p>Bears are the more terrible antagonists from their extreme
tenacity of life, and the fearful energy which they compress
into the last moment of existence, when they are suffering from a
mortal wound. Unless struck in the heart or brain, the mortally-wounded
Bear is more to be feared than if it had received no
injury whatever, and contrives to wreak more harm in the few
minutes that immediately precede its death, than it had achieved
while still uninjured.</p>

<p>Many a hunter has received mortal hurts by incautiously approaching
a Bear, which lay apparently dead, but was in reality
only stunned.</p>

<h2>THE PORCUPINE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Presumed identity of the Kippôd with the Porcupine&mdash;Habits of the Porcupine&mdash;the
common Porcupine found plentifully in Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>Although, like the hedgehog, the Porcupine is not mentioned
by name in the Scriptures, many commentators think that the
word Kippôd signifies both the hedgehog and Porcupine.</p>

<p>That the two animals should be thought to be merely two
varieties of one species is not astonishing, when we remember
the character of the people among whom the Porcupine lives.
Not having the least idea of scientific geology, they look only to
the most conspicuous characteristics, and because the Porcupine
and hedgehog are both covered with an armature of quills, and
the quills are far more conspicuous than the teeth, the inhabitants
of Palestine naturally class the two animals together. In
reality, they belong to two very different orders, the hedgehog
being classed with the shrew-mice and moles, while the Porcupine
is a rodent animal, and is classed with the rats, rabbits,
beavers, marmots, and other rodents.</p>

<p>It is quite as common in Palestine as the hedgehog, a fact
which increases the probability that the two animals may have
been mentioned under a common title. Being a nocturnal
animal, it retires during the day-time to some crevice in a rock or
burrow in the ground, and there lies sleeping until the sunset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
awakens it and calls it to action. And as the hedgehog is also
a nocturnal animal, the similarity of habit serves to strengthen
the mutual resemblance.</p>

<p>The Porcupine is peculiarly fitted for living in dry and unwatered
spots, as, like many other animals, of which our
common rabbit is a familiar example, it can exist without
water, obtaining the needful moisture from the succulent roots
on which it feeds.</p>

<p>The sharply pointed quills with which its body is covered are
solid, and strengthened in a most beautiful manner by internal
ribs, that run longitudinally through them, exactly like those
of the hollow iron masts, which are now coming so much into
use. As they are, in fact, greatly developed hairs, they are continually
shed and replaced, and when they are about to fall are
so loosely attached that they fall off if pulled slightly, or even if
the animal shakes itself. Consequently the shed quills that lie
about the localities inhabited by the Porcupine indicate its
whereabouts, and so plentiful are these quills in some places,
that quite a bundle can be collected in a short time.</p>

<p>There are many species of Porcupines which inhabit different
parts of the world, but that which has been mentioned is the
common Porcupine of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>

<h2>THE MOLE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The two Hebrew words which are translated as Mole&mdash;Obscurity of the former
name&mdash;A parallel case in our own language&mdash;The second name&mdash;The Moles
and the Bats, why associated together&mdash;The real Mole of Scripture, its different
names, and its place in zoology&mdash;Description of the Mole-rat and its general
habits&mdash;Curious superstition&mdash;Discovery of the species by Mr. Tristram&mdash;Scripture
and science&mdash;How the Mole-rat finds its food&mdash;Distinction between
the Mole and the present animal.</p></blockquote>


<p>There are two words which are translated as Mole in our
authorized version of the Bible. One of them is so obscure that
there seems no possibility of deciding the creature that is represented
by it. We cannot even tell to what class of the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
kingdom it refers, because in more than one place it is mentioned
as one of the unclean birds that might not be eaten (translated
as <em>swan</em> in our version), whereas, in another place, it is enumerated
among the unclean creeping things.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="mole" id="mole"></a>
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="450" height="389" alt="mole" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE MOLE-RAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We may conjecture that the same word might be used to
designate two distinct animals, though we have no clue to their
identification. It is rather a strange coincidence, in corroboration
of this theory, that our word Mole signifies three distinct objects&mdash;firstly,
an animal; secondly, a cutaneous growth; and
thirdly, a bank of earth. Now, supposing English to be a dead
language, like the Hebrew, it may well be imagined that a translator
of an English book would feel extremely perplexed when
he saw the word Mole used in such widely different senses.</p>

<p>The best Hebraists can do no more than offer a conjecture
founded on the structure of the word <em>Tinshemeth</em>, which is
thought by some to be the chameleon. Some think that it
is the Mole, some the ibis, some the salamander, while others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
consider it to be the centipede; and in neither case have any
decisive arguments been adduced.</p>

<p>We will therefore leave the former of these two names, and
proceed to the second, <em>Chephor-peroth</em>.</p>

<p>This word occurs in that passage of Isaiah which has already
been quoted when treating of the bat. "In that day a man shall
cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they made
each one to himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; to
go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged
rocks, for fear of the Lord and for the glory of his majesty, when
he ariseth to shake terribly the earth."</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the animal in question is the Mole
of Palestine, which is not the same as our European species, but
is much larger in size, and belongs to a different order of mammalia.
The true Mole is one of the insectivorous and carnivorous
animals, and is allied to the shrews and the hedgehogs; whereas
the Mole of Palestine (<em>Spalax typhlus</em>) is one of the rodents,
and allied to the rabbits, mice, marmots, and jerboas. A better
term for it is the Mole-rat, by which name it is familiar to
zoologists. It is also known by the names of Slepez and
Nenni.</p>

<p>In length it is about eight inches, and its colour is a pale slate.
As is the case with the true Moles, the eyes are of very minute
dimensions, and are not visible through the thick soft fur with
which the whole head and body are covered. Neither are there
any visible external ears, although the ear is really very large,
and extremely sensitive to sound. This apparent privation of
both ears and eyes gives to the animal a most singular and
featureless appearance, its head being hardly recognisable as such
but for the mouth, and the enormous projecting teeth, which not
only look formidable, but really are so. There is a curious
superstition in the Ukraine, that if a man will dare to grasp a
Mole-rat in his bare hand, allow it to bite him, and then squeeze
it to death, the hand that did the deed will ever afterwards
possess the virtue of healing goitre or scrofula.</p>

<p>This animal is spread over a very large tract of country, and
is very common in Palestine. Mr. Tristram gives an interesting
account of its discovery. "We had long tried in vain to capture
the Mole of Palestine. Its mines and its mounds we had seen
everywhere, and reproached ourselves with having omitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
mole-trap among the items of our outfit. From the size of the
mounds and the shallowness of the subterranean passages, we
felt satisfied it could not be the European species, and our hopes
of solving the question were raised when we found that one of
them had taken up its quarters close to our camp. After several
vain attempts to trap it, an Arab one night brought a live Mole
in a jar to the tent. It was no Mole properly so called, but the
Mole-rat, which takes its place throughout Western Asia. The
man, having observed our anxiety to possess a specimen, refused
to part with it for less than a hundred piastres, and scornfully
rejected the twenty piastres I offered. Ultimately, Dr. Chaplin
purchased it for five piastres after our departure, and I kept it
alive for some time in a box, feeding it on sliced onions."</p>

<p>The same gentleman afterwards caught many of the Mole-rats,
and kept them in earthen vessels, as they soon gnawed their
way through wood. They fed chiefly on bulbs, but also ate
sopped bread. Like many other animals, they reposed during
the day, and were active throughout the night.</p>

<p>The author then proceeds to remark on the peculiarly appropriate
character of the prophecy that the idols should be cast
to the Moles and the bats. Had the European Mole been the
animal to which reference was made, there would have been
comparatively little significance in the connexion of the two
names, because, although both animals are lovers of darkness,
they do not inhabit similar localities. But the Mole-rat is fond
of frequenting deserted ruins and burial-places, so that the
Moles and the bats are really companions, and as such are associated
together in the sacred narrative. Here, as in many other
instances, we find that closer study of the Scriptures united to
more extended knowledge are by no means the enemies of
religion, as some well-meaning, but narrow-minded persons
think. On the contrary, the Scriptures were never so well
understood, and their truth and force so well recognised, as at
the present day; and science has proved to be, not the destroyer
of the Bible, but its interpreter. We shall soon cease to hear of
"Science <em>versus</em> the Bible," and shall substitute "Science and
the Bible <em>versus</em> Ignorance and Prejudice."</p>

<p>The Mole-rat needs not to dig such deep tunnels as the true
Moles, because its food does not lie so deep. The Moles live
chiefly upon earthworms, and are obliged to procure them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
varying depths to which they burrow. But the Mole-rat lives
mostly upon roots, preferring those of a bulbous nature. Now
bulbous roots are, as a rule, situated near the surface of the
ground, and, therefore, any animal which feeds upon them
must be careful not to burrow too deeply, lest it should pass
beneath them. The shallowness of the burrows is thus accounted
for. Gardens are often damaged by this animal, the root-crops,
such as carrots and onions, affording plenty of food without
needing much exertion.</p>

<p>The Mole-rat does not keep itself quite so jealously secluded as
does our common Mole, but occasionally will come out of the
burrow and lie on the ground, enjoying the warm sunshine. Still
it is not easily to be approached; for though its eyes are almost
useless, the ears are so sharp, and the animal is so wary, that at
the sound of a footstep it instantly seeks the protection of its
burrow, where it may bid defiance to its foes.</p>

<p>How it obtains its food is a mystery. There seems to be
absolutely no method of guiding itself to the precise spot where
a bulb may be growing. It is not difficult to conjecture the
method by which the Mole discovers its prey. Its sensitive ears
may direct it to the spot where a worm is driving its way
through the earth, and should it come upon its prey, the very
touch of the worm, writhing in terror at the approach of its
enemy, would be sufficient to act as a guide. I have kept
several Moles, and always noticed that, though they would pass
close to a worm without seeming to detect its presence, either
by sight or scent, at the slightest touch they would spring
round, dart on the worm, and in a moment seize it between their
jaws. But with the Mole-rat the case is different. The root can
utter no sound, and can make no movement, nor is it likely that
the odour of the bulb should penetrate through the earth to a
very great distance.</p>

<h2>THE MOUSE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Mice which marred the land&mdash;The Field-mouse&mdash;Its destructive habits and
prolific nature&mdash;The Hamster, and its habits&mdash;The Jerboa, its activity and destructiveness&mdash;Various
species of Dormice and Sand-rats.</p></blockquote>


<p>That the Mouse mentioned in the Old Testament was some
species of rodent animal is tolerably clear, though it is impossible
to state any particular species as being signified by the
Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Akbar</i>. The probable derivation of this name is
from two words which signify "destruction of corn," and it is
therefore evident that allusion is made to some animal which
devours the produce of the fields, and which exists in sufficient
numbers to make its voracity formidable.</p>

<p>Some commentators on the Old Testament translate the
word Akbar as jerboa. Now, although the jerboa is common in
Syria, it is not nearly so plentiful as other rodent animals, and
would scarcely be selected as the means by which a terrible
disaster is made to befall a whole country. The student of
Scripture is well aware that, in those exceptional occurrences
which are called miracles, a needless development of the
wonder-working power is never employed. We are not to suppose,
for example, that the clouds of locusts that devoured the
harvests of the Egyptians were created for this express purpose,
but that their already existing hosts were concentrated upon a
limited area, instead of being spread over a large surface. Nor
need we fancy that the frogs which rendered their habitations
unclean, and contaminated their food, were brought into existence
simply to inflict a severe punishment on the fastidious and
superstitious Egyptians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, had such an exercise of creative power been needed,
it would have been used, but we can all see that a needless
miracle is never worked. He who would not suffer even a
crumb of the miraculously multiplied bread to be wasted, is not
likely to waste that power by which the miracle was wrought.</p>

<p>If we refer to the early history of the Israelitish nation, as
told in 1 Sam. iv.-vi., we shall find that the Israelites made an
unwarrantable use of the ark, by taking it into battle, and that it
was captured and carried off into the country of the Philistines.
Then various signs were sent to warn the captors to send the ark
back to its rightful possessors. Dagon, their great god, was prostrated
before it, painful diseases attacked them, so that many
died, and scarcely any seem to have escaped, while their harvests
were ravaged by numbers of "mice that marred the land."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MOUSE AND NEST.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The question is now simple enough. If the ordinary translation
is accepted, and the word Akbar rendered as Mouse, would
the necessary conditions be fulfilled, <em>i.e.</em> would the creature be
destructive, and would it exist in very great numbers? Now we
shall find that both these conditions are fulfilled by the common
Field-mouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>This little creature is, in proportion to its size, one of the most
destructive animals in the world. Let its numbers be increased
from any cause whatever, and it will most effectually "mar
the land." It will devour every cereal that is sown, and kill
almost any sapling that is planted. It does not even wait for
the corn to spring up, but will burrow beneath the surface, and
dig out the seed before it has had time to sprout. In the early
part of the year, it will eat the green blade as soon as it springs
out of the ground, and is an adept at climbing the stalks of corn,
and plundering the ripe ears in the autumn.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="jerboa" id="jerboa"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JERBOA, OR LEAPING MOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When stacked or laid up in barns, the harvest is by no means
safe, for the Mice will penetrate into any ordinary barn, and find
their way into any carelessly-built stack, from which they can
scarcely be ejected. The rat itself is not so dire a foe to the
farmer, as the less obtrusive, but equally mischievous Field-mouse.
The ferret will drive the rats out of their holes, and if
they have taken possession of a wheat-stack they can be ejected
by depriving them of access to water. But the burrows of the
Field-mouse are so small that a ferret cannot make its way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
through them, and the nightly dew that falls on the stack affords
an ample supply of water.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="field" id="field"></a>
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="400" height="466" alt="field" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE FIELD-MOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the Field-mouse is deprived of the food which it loves
best, it finds a subsistence among the trees. Whenever mice can
discover a newly-planted sapling, they hold great revel upon it,
eating away the tender young bark as high as they can reach,
and consequently destroying the tree as effectually as if it were
cut down. Even when the young trees fail them, and no tender
bark is to be had, the Field-mice can still exert their destructive
powers. They will then betake themselves to the earth, burrow
beneath its surface, and devour the young rootlets of the forest
trees. All botanists know that a healthy tree is continually
pushing forward fresh roots below the ground, in order to gain
sufficient nourishment to supply the increasing growth above.
If, therefore, these young roots are destroyed, the least harm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that can happen to the tree is that its further growth is arrested;
while, in many cases, the tree, which cannot repair the injuries
it has received, droops gradually, and finally dies. Even in this
country, the Field-mouse has proved itself a terrible enemy to
the agriculturist, and has devastated considerable tracts of land.</p>

<p>So much for the destructive powers of the Field-mouse, and
the next point to be considered is its abundance.</p>

<p>Nearly all the rats and mice are singularly prolific animals,
producing a considerable number at a brood, and having several
broods in a season. The Field-mouse is by no means an exception
to the general rule, but produces as many young in a season
as any of the Mice.</p>

<p>Not only is it formidable from its numbers, but from the insidious
nature of its attacks. Any one can see a rabbit, a hare,
or even a rat; but to see a Field-mouse is not easy, even when the
little creatures are present in thousands. A Field-mouse never
shows itself except from necessity, its instinct teaching it to
escape the observation of its many furred and feathered enemies.
Short-legged and soft-furred, it threads its noiseless way among
the herbage with such gentle suppleness that scarcely a grass-blade
is stirred, while, if it should be forced to pass over a spot
of bare ground, the red-brown hue of its fur prevents it from
being detected by an inexperienced eye. Generally the Field-mouse
is safe from human foes, and has only to dread the
piercing eye and swift wings of the hawk, or the silent flight
and sharp talons of the owl.</p>

<p>Although there can be no doubt that the Field-mouse is one
of the animals to which the name of Akbar is given, it is probable
that many species were grouped under this one name.
Small rodents of various kinds are very plentiful in Palestine,
and there are several species closely allied to the Field-mouse
itself.</p>

<p>Among them is the Hamster (<em>Cricetus frumentarius</em>), so
widely known for the ravages which it makes among the crops.
This terribly destructive animal not only steals the crops for
immediate subsistence, but lays up a large stock of provisions
for the winter, seeming to be actuated by a sort of miserly
passion for collecting and storing away. There seems to be no
bounds to the quantity of food which a Hamster will carry
into its subterranean store-house, from seventy to one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pounds' weight being sometimes taken out of the burrow of a
single animal. The fact of the existence of these large stores
shows that the animal must need them, and accordingly we find
that the Hamster is only a partial hibernator, as it is awake
during a considerable portion of the winter months, and is consequently
obliged to live on the stores which it has collected.</p>

<p>It is an exceedingly prolific animal, each pair producing on an
average twenty-five young in the course of a year. The families
are unsociable, and, as soon as they are strong enough to feed
themselves, the young Hamsters leave their home, and make
separate burrows for themselves. Thus we see that the Hamster,
as well as the Field-mouse, fulfils the conditions which are
needed in order to class it under the general title of Akbar.</p>

<p>I have already stated that some translators of the Bible use
the word Jerboa as a rendering of the Hebrew Akbar. As the
Jerboa certainly is found in Palestine, there is some foundation
for this idea, and we may safely conjecture that it also is one of
the smaller rodents which are grouped together under the appellation
of Mouse.</p>

<p>The Common Jerboa (<em>Dipus Ægyptiacus</em>) is plentiful in Palestine,
and several other species inhabit the same country, known
at once by their long and slender legs, which give them so
curious a resemblance to the kangaroos of Australia. The Jerboas
pass over the ground with astonishing rapidity. Instead of
creeping stealthily among the grass-blades, like the short-limbed
field-mouse, the Jerboa flies along with a succession of wonderful
leaps, darting here and there with such rapidity that the eye can
scarcely follow its wayward movements. When quiet and undisturbed,
it hops along gently enough, but as soon as it takes
alarm, it darts off in its peculiar manner, which is to the ordinary
walk of quadrupeds what the devious course of a frightened
snipe is to the steady flight of birds in general.</p>

<p>It prefers hot and dry situations, its feet being defended by a
thick coating of stiff hairs, which serve the double purpose of
protecting it from the heat, and giving it a firm hold on the
ground. It is rather a destructive animal, its sharp and powerful
teeth enabling it to bite its way through obstacles which would
effectually stop an ordinary Mouse. That the Jerboa may be
one of the Akbarim is rendered likely by the prohibition in
Lev. xi. 29, forbidding the Mouse to be eaten. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
scarcely probable that such a command need have been issued
against eating the common Mouse, whereas the Jerboa, a much
larger and palatable animal, is always eaten by the Arabs. The
Hamster is at the present day eaten in Northern Syria.</p>

<p>Beside these creatures there are the Dormice, several species
of which animal inhabit Palestine at the present day. There are
also the Sand-rats, one species of which is larger than our ordinary
rats. The Sand-rats live more in the deserts than the
cultivated lands, making their burrows at the foot of hills, and
among the roots of bushes.</p>

<h2>THE HARE.</h2>

<p class="hanging">The prohibitions of the Mosaic law&mdash;The chewing of the cud, and division of the
hoof&mdash;Identity of the Hare of Scripture&mdash;Rumination described&mdash;The Hare
a rodent and not a ruminant&mdash;Cowper and his Hares&mdash;Structure of the rodent

and their habits.</p></blockquote>


<p>Among the many provisions of the Mosaic law are several which
refer to the diet of the Israelites, and which prohibit certain
kinds of food. Special stress is laid upon the flesh of animals,
and the list of those which may be lawfully eaten is a singularly
restricted one, all being excluded except those which "divide the
hoof and chew the cud." And, lest there should be any mistake
about the matter, examples are given both of those animals
which may and those which may not be eaten.</p>

<p>The ox, sheep, goat, and antelopes generally are permitted as
lawful food, because they fulfil both conditions; whereas there is
a special prohibition of the swine, because it divides the hoof
but does not chew the cud, and of the camel, coney, and hare
because they chew the cud, but do not divide the hoof. Our
business at present is with the last of these animals.</p>

<p>Considerable discussion has been raised concerning this
animal, because, as is well known to naturalists, the Hare is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
one of the ruminant animals, but belongs to the same order as
the rat, rabbit, beaver, and other rodents. Neither its teeth nor
its stomach are constructed for the purpose of enabling it to
ruminate, <em>i.e.</em> to return into the mouth the partially-digested
food, and then to masticate it afresh; and therefore it has been
thought that either there is some mistake in the sacred narrative
or that the Hebrew word has been mistranslated.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="hare" id="hare"></a>
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="450" height="396" alt="hare" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SYRIAN HARE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Taking the latter point first, as being the simplest of the two,
we find that the Hebrew word which is rendered as Hare is
Arnebeth, and that it is rendered in the Septuagint as Dasypus,
or the Hare,&mdash;a rendering which the Jewish Bible adopts.
That the Arnebeth is really the Hare may also be conjectured
from the fact that the Arabic name for that animal is Arneb.
In consequence of the rather wide sense to which the Greek
word Dasypus (<em>i.e.</em> hairy-foot) is used, some commentators have
suggested that the rabbit may have been included in the same
title. This, however, is not at all likely, inasmuch as the Hare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
is very plentiful in Palestine, and the rabbit is believed not to
be indigenous to that part of the world. And, even if the two
animals had been classed under the same title, the physiological
difficulty would not be removed.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, it will be as well to give a brief
description of the curious act called rumination, or "chewing
the cud."</p>

<p>There are certain animals, such as the oxen, antelopes, deer,
sheep, goats, camels, &amp;c. which have teeth unfitted for the rapid
mastication of food, and which therefore are supplied with a
remarkable apparatus by which the food can be returned into
the mouth when the animal has leisure, and be re-masticated
before it passes into the true digestive organs.</p>

<p>For this purpose they are furnished with four stomachs, which
are arranged in the following order. First comes the paunch or
"rumen" (whence the word "ruminating"), into which passes the
food in a very rough state, just as it is torn, rather than bitten,
from the herbage, and which is analogous to the crop in birds. It
thence passes into the second stomach, or "honeycomb," the
walls of which are covered with small angular cells. Into those
cells the food is received from the first stomach, and compressed
into little balls, which can be voluntarily returned into the
mouth for mastication.</p>

<p>After the second mastication has been completed, the food
passes at once into the third stomach, and thence into the fourth,
which is the true digesting cavity. By a peculiar structure of
these organs, the animal is able to convey its food either into
the first or third stomach, at will, <em>i.e.</em> into the first when the grass
is eaten, and into the third after rumination. Thus it will be seen
that an animal which chews the cud must have teeth of a certain
character, and be possessed of the fourfold stomach which has
just been described.</p>

<p>Two points are conceded which seem to be utterly irreconcilable
with each other. The first is that the Mosaic law
distinctly states that the Hare chews the cud; the second is
that in point of fact the Hare is not, and cannot be, a ruminating
animal, possessing neither the teeth nor the digestive
organs which are indispensable for that process. Yet, totally
opposed as these statements appear to be, they are in fact, not so
irreconcilable as they seem.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Why the flesh of certain animals was prohibited, we do not at
the present time know. That the flesh of swine should be forbidden
food is likely enough, considering the effects which the
habitual eating of swine's flesh is said to produce in hot countries.
But it does seem very strange that the Israelites should have
been forbidden to eat the flesh of the camel, the coney (or hyrax),
and the Hare, and that these animals should have been specified
is a proof that the eating or refraining from their flesh was not
a mere sanitary regulation, but was a matter of importance.
The flesh of all these three animals is quite as good and
nutritious as that of the oxen, or goats, which are eaten in
Palestine, and that of the Hare is far superior to them. Therefore,
the people of Israel, who were always apt to take liberties
with the restrictive laws, and were crafty enough to evade them
on so many occasions, would have been likely to pronounce that
the flesh of the Hare was lawful meat, because the animal chewed
the cud, or appeared to do so, and they would discreetly have
omitted the passage which alluded to the division of the hoof.</p>

<p>To a non-scientific observer the Hare really does appear to
chew the cud. When it is reposing at its ease, it continually
moves its jaws about as if eating something, an action which
may readily be mistaken for true rumination. Even Cowper,
the poet, who kept some hares for several years, and had them
always before his eyes, was deceived by this mumbling movement
of the jaws. Speaking of his favourite hare, "Puss," he
proceeds as follows: "Finding him exceedingly tractable, I
made it my custom to carry him always after breakfast into the
garden, where he hid himself generally under the leaves of a
cucumber vine, sleeping, <em>or chewing the cud</em>, till evening."</p>

<p>The real object of this continual grinding or mumbling movement
is simple enough. The chisel-like incisor teeth of the
rodent animals need to be rubbed against each other, in order to
preserve their edge and shape, and if perchance such friction
should be wanting to a tooth, as, for example, by the breaking of
the opposite tooth, it becomes greatly elongated, and sometimes
grows to such a length as to prevent the animal from eating.
Instinctively, therefore, the Hare, as well as the rabbit and
other rodents, always likes to be nibbling at something, as any one
knows who has kept rabbits in wooden hutches, the object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
this nibbling not being to eat the wood, but to keep the teeth
in order.</p>

<p>But we may naturally ask ourselves, why the Mosaic law, an
emanation from heaven, should mention an animal as being a
ruminant, when its very structure shows that such an act was
utterly impossible? The answer is clear enough. The law was
suited to the capacity of those for whom it was intended, and
was never meant to be a handbook of science, as well as a code
of religious duties and maxims. The Jews, like other Orientals,
were indifferent to that branch of knowledge which we designate
by the name of physical science, and it was necessary that the
language in which the law was conveyed to them should be
accommodated to their capabilities of receiving it.</p>

<p>It would have been worse than useless to have interrupted
the solemn revelation of Divine will with a lesson in comparative
anatomy; the object of the passage in question being, not to
teach the Jews the distinctive characteristics of a rodent and a
ruminant, but to guard against their mistaking the Hare for one
of the ruminants which were permitted as food. That they
would in all probability have fallen into that mistake is evident
from the fact that the Arabs are exceedingly fond of the flesh of
the Hare, and accept it, as well as the camel, as lawful food,
because it chews the cud, the division of the hoof not being
considered by them as an essential.</p>

<p>Hares are very plentiful in Palestine, and at least two species
are found in that country. One of them, which inhabits the
more northern and hilly portion of Palestine, closely resembles
our own species, but has not ears quite so long in proportion,
while the head is broader. The second species, which lives in
the south, and in the valley of the Jordan, is very small, is of a
light dun colour, and has very long ears. In their general
habits, these Hares resemble the Hare of England.</p>

<p>Under this head we shall treat of the domesticated oxen of
Scripture, whether mentioned as Bull, Cow, Ox, Calf, Heifer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Two distinct species of cattle are found in Palestine, namely,
the ordinary domesticated ox, and the Indian buffalo, which
lives in the low-lying and marshy valley of the Jordan. Of this
species we shall treat presently.</p>

<p>The domesticated cattle are very much like our own, but there
is not among them that diversity of breed for which this country
is famous; nor is there even any distinction of long and short
horned cattle. There are some places where the animals are
larger than in others, but this difference is occasioned simply by
the better quality and greater quantity of the food.</p>

<p>As is the case in most parts of the world where civilization
has made any progress, Domesticated Cattle were, and still are,
plentiful in Palestine. Even at the present time the cattle are
in common use, though it is evident, from many passages of
Holy Writ, that in the days of Judæa's prosperity cattle were far
more numerous than they are now, and were treated in a better
fashion.</p>

<p>To take their most sacred use first, a constant supply of cattle
was needed for the sacrifices, and, as it was necessary that every
animal which was brought to the altar should be absolutely
perfect, it is evident that great care was required in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that the breed should not deteriorate, a skill which has long
been rendered useless by the abandonment of the sacrifices.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ALTAR OF BURNT-OFFERING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another reason for their better nurture in the times of old is
that in those days the ox was largely fed and fatted for the
table, just as is done with ourselves. At the present day, the
flesh of the cattle is practically unused as food, that of the sheep
or goat being always employed, even when a man gives a feast
to his friends. But, in the old times, stalled oxen, <em>i.e.</em> oxen kept
asunder from those which were used for agricultural purposes,
and expressly fatted for the table, were in constant use. See for
example the well-known passage in the Prov. xv. 17, "Better is
a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred
therewith." Again, the Prophet Jeremiah makes use of a
curious simile, "Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction
cometh; it cometh out of the north. Also her hired men are in
the midst of her like fatted bullocks [or, bullocks of the stall],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
for they also are turned back, and are fled away together."
(Jer. xlvi. 20.) And in 1 Kings iv. 22, 23, when describing the
glories of Solomon's household, the sacred writer draws a distinction
between the oxen which were especially fattened for the
table of the king and the superior officers, and those which were
consumed by the lower orders of his household: "And Solomon's
provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore
measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the
pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and
fallow-deer, and fatted fowl."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNS, AND THE FATTED CALF IS KILLED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Calves&mdash;mostly, if not always, bull-calves&mdash;were largely used
for food in Palestine, and in the households of the wealthy were
fatted for the table. See, for example, the familiar parable of
the prodigal son, in which the rejoicing father is mentioned as
preparing a great feast in honour of his son's return, and ordering
the fatted calf to be killed&mdash;the calf in question being evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
one of the animals that were kept in good condition against any
festive occasion. And, even in the earliest history of the Bible,
the custom of keeping a fatted calf evidently prevailed, as is
shown by the conduct of Abraham, who, when he was visited by
the three heavenly guests, "ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf,
tender and good," and had it killed and dressed at once, after the
still existing fashion of the East.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 363px;"><a name="abraham" id="abraham"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ABRAHAM OFFERS FOOD TO THE THREE STRANGERS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But, even in the times of Israel's greatest prosperity, the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
use of the ox was as an agricultural labourer, thus reversing the
custom of this country, where the horse has taken the place of
the ox as a beast of draught, and where cattle are principally
fed for food. Ploughing was, and is, always performed by oxen,
and allusions to this office are scattered plentifully through the
Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>When understood in this sense, oxen are almost always
spoken of in connexion with the word "yoke," and as each yoke
comprised two oxen, it is evident that the word is used as we
employ the term "brace," or pair. The yoke, which is the chief
part of the harness, is a very simple affair. A tolerably stout
beam of wood is cut of a sufficient length to rest upon the necks
of the oxen standing side by side, and a couple of hollows are
scooped out to receive the crest of the neck. In order to hold
it in its place, two flexible sticks are bent under their necks,
and the ends fixed into the beam of the yoke. In the middle
of this yoke is fastened the pole of the plough or cart, and this
is all the harness that is used, not even traces being required.</p>

<p>It will be seen that so rude an implement as this would
be very likely to gall the necks of the animals, unless the
hollows were carefully smoothed, and the heavy beam adapted
to the necks of the animals. This galling nature of the yoke, so
familiar to the Israelites, is used repeatedly as a metaphor in
many passages of the Old and New Testaments. These passages
are too numerous to be quoted, but I will give one or two of the
most conspicuous among them. The earliest mention of the
yoke in the Scriptures is a metaphor.</p>

<p>After Jacob had deceived his father, in procuring for himself
the blessing which was intended for his elder brother, Isaac
comforts Esau by the prophecy that, although he must serve his
brother, yet "it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the
dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
Again, in the next passage where the yoke is mentioned, namely,
Lev. xxvi. 13, the word is employed in the metaphorical sense:
"I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the
land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen, and I have
broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright."</p>

<p>The plough was equally simple, and consisted essentially of a
bent branch, one end of which was armed with an iron point by
way of a share, while the other formed the pole or beam, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
was fastened to the middle of the yoke. It was guided by a
handle, which was usually a smaller branch that grew from the
principal one. A nearly similar instrument is used in Asia
Minor to the present day, and is a curious relic of the most
ancient times of history, for we find on the Egyptian monuments
figures of the various agricultural processes, in which the plough
is made after this simple manner.</p>

<p>Of course such an instrument is a very ineffective one, and can
but scratch, rather than plough the ground, the warmth of the
climate and fertility of the land rendering needless the deep
ploughing of our own country, where the object is to turn up
the earth to the greatest possible depth. One yoke of oxen was
generally sufficient to draw a plough, but occasionally a much
greater number were required. We read, for example, of Elisha,
who, when he received his call from Elijah, was ploughing with
twelve yoke of oxen, <em>i. e.</em> twenty-four. It has been suggested,
that the twelve yoke of oxen were not all attached to the same
plough, but that there were twelve ploughs, each with its single
yoke of oxen. This was most probably the case.</p>

<p>The instrument with which the cattle were driven was not a
whip, but a goad. This goad was a long and stout stick, armed
with a spike at one end, and having a kind of spud at the other,
with which the earth could be scraped off the share when it
became clogged. Such an instrument might readily be used as
a weapon, and, in the hands of a powerful man, might be made
even more formidable than a spear. As a weapon, it often was
used, as we see from many passages of the Scriptures. For
example, it is said in Judges iii. 31, "that Shamgar the son of
Anath killed six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad."</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the beginning of Saul's reign, when the
Israelites fairly measured themselves against the Philistines, it
was found that only Saul and Jonathan were even tolerably
armed. Fearful of the numbers and spirit of the Israelites, the
Philistines had disarmed them, and were so cautious that they
did not even allow them to possess forges wherewith to make or
sharpen the various agricultural instruments which they possessed,
lest they should surreptitiously provide themselves with
weapons. The only smith's tool which they were allowed to
retain was a file with which each man might trim the edges of the
ploughshares, mattocks, axes, and sharpen the points of the goad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
The only weapons which they could muster were made of their
agricultural implements, and among the most formidable of
them was the goad.</p>

<p>How the goad came into use in Palestine may easily be seen.
The Egyptians, from among whom the people of Israel passed
into the Promised Land, did not use the goad in ploughing, but
the whip, which, from the representations on the Egyptian
monuments, was identical with the koorbash, or "cow-hide"
whip, which is now in use in the same country. But this
terrible whip, which is capable, when wielded by a skilful hand,
of cutting deep grooves through the tough hide of the ox, could
not be obtained by the Jews, because the hippopotamus, of whose
hide it was made, did not live in or near Palestine. They
therefore were forced to use some other instrument wherewith
to urge on the oxen, and the goad was clearly the simplest and
most effective implement for this purpose.</p>

<p>After the land was ploughed and sown, and the harvest was
ripened, the labours of the oxen were again called into requisition,
first for threshing out the corn, and next for carrying or
drawing the grain to the storehouses.</p>

<p>In the earlier days, the process of threshing was very simple.
A circular piece of ground was levelled, and beaten very hard
and flat, its diameter being from fifty to a hundred feet. On
this ground the corn was thrown, and a number of oxen were
driven here and there on it, so that the constant trampling of
their feet shook the ripe grain out of the ears. The corn was
gathered together in the middle of the floor, and as fast as it
was scattered by the feet of the oxen, it was thrown back
towards the centre.</p>

<p>Afterwards, an improvement was introduced in the form of a
rough sledge, called "moreg," to which the oxen were harnessed
by a yoke, and on which the driver stood as he guided his team
round the threshing-floor. This instrument is mentioned in
Isa. xli. 15: "Behold, I will make thee a new and sharp threshing
instrument having teeth [or mouths]: thou shalt thresh the mountains,
and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff."
Mention is also made of the same implement in 2 Sam. xxiv. 22,
where it is related that Araunah the Jebusite offered to give
David the oxen for a burnt-sacrifice, and the moregs and other
implements as wood with which they could be burned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of treading out the corn was a hard and trying one
for the oxen, and it was probably on this account that the kindly
edict was made, that the oxen who trod out the corn should not
be muzzled. As a rule, the cattle were not fed nearly as carefully
as is done with us, and so the labours of the threshing-floor
would find a compensation in the temporary abundance of
which the animals might take their fill.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">OXEN TREADING OUT GRAIN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After the corn was threshed, or rather trodden out, the oxen
had to draw it home in carts. These were but slight improvements
on the threshing-sledge, and were simply trays or shallow
boxes on a pair of wheels. As the wheels were merely slices cut
from the trunk of a tree, and were not furnished with iron tires,
they were not remarkable for roundness, and indeed, after a
little time, were worn into rather irregular ovals, so that the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of dragging a cart over the rough roads was by no means an
easy one. And, as the axle was simply a stout pole fastened to
the bottom of the cart, and having its rounded ends thrust
through holes in the middle of the wheels, the friction was
enormous. As, moreover, oil and grease were far too precious
luxuries to be wasted in lubricating the axles, the creaking
and groaning of the wheels was a singularly disagreeable and
ear-piercing sound.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">EASTERN OX-CART.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The common hackery of India is a good example of the carts
mentioned in the Scriptures. As with the plough, the cart was
drawn by a couple of oxen, connected by the yoke. The two
kinds of cart, namely, the tray and the box, are clearly indicated
in the Scriptures. The new cart on which the Ark was placed
when it was sent back by the Philistines (see 1 Sam. vi. 7) was
evidently one of the former kind, and so was that which was
made twenty years afterwards, for the purpose of conveying the
Ark to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Although the cattle were evidently better tended in the olden
times than at present, those animals which were used for agriculture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
seem to have passed rather a rough life, especially in the
winter time. It is rather curious that the Jews should have
had no idea of preserving the grass by making it into hay, as is
done in Europe. Consequently the chief food of the cattle was
the straw and chaff which remained on the threshing-floor after
the grain had been separated.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT BEING DRAWN BY COWS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This, indeed, was the only use to which the straw could be
put, for it was so crushed and broken by the feet of the oxen
and the threshing-sledge that it was rendered useless.</p>

<p>The want of winter forage is the chief reason why cattle are
so irregularly disposed over Palestine, many parts of that
country being entirely without them, and only those districts
containing them in which fresh forage may be found throughout
the year.</p>

<p>Except a few yoke of oxen, which are kept in order to draw
carts, and act as beasts of burden, the cattle are turned loose
for a considerable portion of the year, and run about in herds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
from one pasturage to another. Thus they regain many of the
characteristics of wild animals, and it is to this habit of theirs
that many of the Scriptural allusions can be traced.</p>

<p>For example, see Ps. xxii. 12, "Many bulls have compassed
me, strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. They
gaped on me with their mouths [or, their mouths opened against
me] as a ravening and a roaring lion." This passage alludes to
the curiosity inherent in cattle, which have a habit of following
objects which they do not understand or dislike, and surrounding
it with looks of grave wonderment. Even in their domesticated
state this habit prevails. When I was a boy, I sometimes
amused myself with going into a field where a number of cows
and oxen were grazing, and lying down in the middle of it.
The cattle would soon become uneasy, toss their heads about,
and gradually draw near on every side, until at last they would
be pressed together closely in a circle, with their heads just
above the object of their astonishment. Their curious, earnest
looks have always been present to my mind when reading the
above quoted passage.</p>

<p>The Psalmist does not necessarily mean that the bulls in
question were dangerous animals. On the contrary, the bulls
of Palestine are gentle in comparison with our own animals,
which are too often made savage by confinement and the harsh
treatment to which they are subjected by rough and ignorant
labourers. In Palestine a pair of bulls may constantly be seen
attached to the same yoke, a thing that never would be seen in
this country.</p>

<p>The custom of turning the herds of cattle loose to find
pasture for themselves is alluded to in Joel i. 18, "How do
the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed because they
have no pasture." We can easily imagine to ourselves the
terrible time to which the prophet refers, "when the rivers
of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures
of the wilderness," as it is wont to do when a spark
falls upon grass dried up and withered, by reason of the sun's
heat and the lack of water. Over such a country, first withered
by drought, and then desolated by fire, would the cattle wander,
vainly searching on the dusty and blackened surface for the
tender young blades which always spring up on a burnt pasture
as soon as the first rains fall. Moaning and bellowing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
thirst and disappointment, they would vainly seek for food or
water in places where the seed lies still under the clods where it
was sown (v. 17), where the vines are dried up, and the fig, the
pomegranate and the palm (v. 12) are all withered for want of
moisture.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="ploughing" id="ploughing"></a>
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="ploughing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PLOUGHING WITH OXEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Such scenes are still to be witnessed in several parts of the
world. Southern Africa is sometimes sadly conspicuous for
them, an exceptional season of drought keeping back the fresh
grass after the old pastures have been burned (the ordinary mode
of cultivating pasture land). Then the vast herds of cattle,
whose milk forms the staff of life to the inhabitants, wander to
and fro, gathering in masses round any spot where a spring still
yields a little water, and bellowing and moaning with thirst as
they press their way towards the spot where their owners are
doling out to each a small measure of the priceless fluid.</p>

<p>The cattle are branded with the mark of their owners, so that
in these large herds there might be no difficulty in distinguishing
them when they were re-captured for the plough and the
cart. On one of the Egyptian monuments there is a very
interesting group, which has furnished the idea for the plate
which illustrates this article. It occurs in the tombs of the
kings at Thebes, and represents a ploughing scene. The simple
two-handled plough is being dragged by a pair of cows, who
have the yoke fastened across the horns instead of lying on
the neck, and a sower is following behind, scattering the grain
out of a basket into the newly-made furrows. In front of the
cows is a young calf, which has run to meet its mother, and is
leaping for joy before her as she steadily plods along her course.</p>

<p>The action of both animals is admirably represented; the
steady and firm gait of the mother contrasting with the light,
gambolling step and arched tail of her offspring.</p>

<p>In the olden times of the Israelitish race, herd-keeping was
considered as an honourable occupation, in which men of the
highest rank might engage without any derogation to their
dignity. We find, for instance, that Saul himself, even after he
had been appointed king, was acting as herdsman when the
people saw the mistake they had made in rejecting him as their
monarch, and came to fetch their divinely-appointed leader from
his retirement. (See 1 Sam. xi. 5.) Doeg, too, the faithful companion
of Saul, was made the chief herdsman of his master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
cattle, so that for Saul to confer such an office, and Doeg to
accept it, shows that the post was one of much honour. And
afterwards, when David was in the zenith of his power, he
completed the organization of his kingdom, portioning out not
only his army into battalions, and assigning a commanding
officer to each battalion, but also appointing a ruler to each
tribe, and setting officers over his treasury, over the vineyards,
over the olive-trees, over the storehouses, and over the cattle. And
these offices were so important that the names of their holders
are given at length in 1 Chron. xxvii. those of the various herdsmen
being thought as worthy of mention as those of the
treasurers, the military commanders, or the headmen of the
tribes.</p>

<p>Before concluding this necessarily short account of the domesticated
oxen of Palestine, it will be needful to give a few lines
to the animal viewed in a religious aspect. Here we have, in
bold contrast to each other, the divine appointment of certain
cattle to be slain as sacrifices, and the reprobation of worship
paid to those very cattle as living emblems of divinity. This
false worship was learned by the Israelites during their long
residence in Egypt, and so deeply had the customs of the Egyptian
religion sunk into their hearts, that they were not eradicated
after the lapse of centuries. It may easily be imagined
that such a superstition, surrounded as it was with every external
circumstance which could make it more imposing, would
take a powerful hold of the Jewish mind.</p>

<p>Chief among the multitude of idols or symbols was the god
Apis, represented by a bull. Many other animals, specially the
cat and the ibis, were deeply honoured among the ancient Egyptians,
as we learn from their own monuments and from the
works of the old historians. All these creatures were symbols
as well as idols, symbols to the educated and idols to the
ignorant.</p>

<p>None of them was held in such universal honour as the bull
Apis. The particular animal which represented the deity, and
which was lodged with great state and honour in his temple at
Memphis, was thought to be divinely selected for the purpose,
and to be impressed with certain marks. His colour must be
black, except a square spot on the forehead, a crescent-shaped
white spot on the right side, and the figure of an eagle on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
back. Under the tongue must be a knob shaped like the sacred
scarabæus, and the hairs of his tail must be double.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="mummy" id="mummy"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MUMMY OF A SACRED BULL TAKEN FROM AN EGYPTIAN TOMB.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This representative animal was only allowed to live for a
certain time, and when he had reached this allotted period, he
was taken in solemn procession to the Nile, and drowned in
its sacred waters. His body was then embalmed, and placed
with great state in the tombs at Memphis.</p>

<p>After his death, whether natural or not, the whole nation
went into mourning, and exhibited all the conventional signs of
sorrow, until the priests found another bull which possessed
the distinctive marks. The people then threw off their mourning
robes, and appeared in their best attire, and the sacred bull
was exhibited in state for forty days before he was taken to his
temple at Memphis. The reader will here remember the analogous
case of the Indian cattle, some of which are held to be
little less than incarnations of divinity.</p>

<p>Even at the very beginning of the exodus, when their minds
must have been filled with the many miracles that had been
wrought in their behalf, and with the cloud and fire of Sinai
actually before their eyes, Aaron himself made an image of a
calf in gold, and set it up as a symbol of the Lord. That the idol
in question was intended as a symbol by Aaron is evident from
the words which he used when summoning the people to worship,
"To-morrow is a feast of the Lord" (Gen. xxxii. 5). The people,
however, clearly lacked the power of discriminating between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a><br /><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
symbol and that which it represented, and worshipped the image
just as any other idol might be worshipped. And, in spite of
the terrible and swift punishment that followed, and which
showed the profanity of the act, the idea of ox-worship still
remained among the people.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JEROBOAM SETS UP A GOLDEN CALF AT BETHEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Five hundred years afterwards we find a familiar example of
it in the conduct of Jeroboam, "who made Israel to sin," the
peculiar crime being the open resuscitation of ox-worship. "The
king made two calves of gold and said unto them, It is too much
for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which
brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And he set the one
in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.... And he made an
house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the
people, which were not of the tribe of Levi. And Jeroboam
ordained a feast ... like unto the feast in Judah, and he
offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto
the calves that he had made."</p>

<p>Here we have a singular instance of a king of Israel repeating,
after a lapse of five hundred years, the very acts which had
drawn down on the people so severe a punishment, and which
were so contrary to the law that they had incited Moses to fling
down and break the sacred tables on which the commandments
had been divinely inscribed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BUFFALO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another species of the ox-tribe now inhabits Palestine
though commentators rather doubt whether it is not a comparatively
late importation. This is the true <span class="smcap">Buffalo</span> (<em>Bubalus
buffelus</em>, Gray), which is spread over a very large portion of the
earth, and is very plentiful in India. In that country there
are two distinct breeds of the Buffalo, namely, the Arnee, a wild
variety, and the Bhainsa, a tamed variety. The former animal
is much larger than the latter, being sometimes more than ten
feet in length from the nose to the root of the tail, and measuring
between six and seven feet in height at the shoulder. Its
horns are of enormous length, the tail is very short, and tufts of
hair grow on the forehead and horns. The tamed variety is at
least one-third smaller, and, unlike the Arnee, never seems to
get into high condition. It is an ugly, ungainly kind of beast,
and is rendered very unprepossessing to the eye by the bald
patches which are mostly found upon its hide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Being a water-loving animal, the Buffalo always inhabits the
low-lying districts, and is fond of wallowing in the oozy marshes
in which it remains for hours, submerged all but its head, and
tranquilly chewing the cud while enjoying its mud-bath. While
thus engaged the animal depresses its horns so that they are
scarcely visible, barely allowing more than its eyes, ears, and
nostrils to remain above the surface, so that the motionless
heads are scarcely distinguishable from the grass and reed tufts
which stud the marshes. Nothing is more startling to an inexperienced
traveller than to pass by a silent and tranquil pool
where the muddy surface is unbroken except by a number of
black lumps and rushy tufts, and then to see these tufts suddenly
transformed into twenty or thirty huge beasts rising out of the
still water as if by magic. Generally, the disturber of their
peace had better make the best of his way out of their reach, as
the Buffalo, whether wild or tame, is of a tetchy and irritable
nature, and resents being startled out of its state of dreamy
repose.</p>

<p>In the Jordan valley the Buffalo is found, and is used for
agriculture, being of the Bhainsa, or domesticated variety.
Being much larger and stronger than the ordinary cattle, it is
useful in drawing the plough, but its temper is too uncertain
to render it a pleasant animal to manage. As is the case with
all half-wild cattle, its milk is very scanty, but compensates
by the richness of the quality for the lack of quantity.</p>

<p>In the picture which appears on a following page, one of these
domesticated Buffaloes is represented, harnessed with a camel, to a
rude form of plough used in the East.</p>

<h2>THE WILD BULL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Tô, Wild Bull of the Old Testament&mdash;Passages in which it is mentioned&mdash;The
Wild Bull in the net&mdash;Hunting with nets in the East&mdash;The Oryx supposed to
be the Tô of Scripture&mdash;Description of the Oryx, its locality, appearance, and
habits&mdash;The points in which the Oryx agrees with the Tô&mdash;The "snare" in
which the foot is taken, as distinguished from the net.</p></blockquote>


<p>In two passages of the Old Testament an animal is mentioned,
respecting which the translators and commentators have been
somewhat perplexed, in one passage being translated as the
"Wild Ox," and in the other as the "Wild Bull." In the
Jewish Bible the same rendering is preserved, but the sign of
doubt is added to the word in both cases, showing that the
translation is an uncertain one.</p>

<p>The first of these passages occurs in Deut. xiv. 5, where it is
classed together with the ox, sheep, goats, and other ruminants,
as one of the beasts which were lawful for food. Now, although
we cannot identify it by this passage, we can at all events ascertain
two important points&mdash;the first, that it was a true ruminant,
and the second, that it was not the ox, the sheep, or the goat.
It was, therefore, some wild ruminant, and we now have to ask
how we are to find out the species.</p>

<p>If we turn to Isa. li. 20, we shall find a passage which will
help us considerably. Addressing Jerusalem, the prophet uses
these words, "By whom shall I comfort thee? Thy sons have
fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in
a net; they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of
thy God." We now see that the Tô or Teô must be an animal
which is captured by means of nets, and therefore must inhabit
spots wherein the toils can be used. Moreover, it is evidently
a powerful animal, or the force of the simile would be lost.
The prophet evidently refers to some large and strong beast
which has been entangled in the hunter's nets, and which lies
helplessly struggling in them. We are, therefore, almost perforce
driven to recognise it as some large antelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The expression used by the prophet is so characteristic that
it needs a short explanation. In this country, and at the present
day, the use of the net is almost entirely restricted to fishing
and bird-catching; but in the East nets are still employed in the
capture of very large game.</p>

<p>A brief allusion to the hunting-net is made at page 31, but, as
the passage in Isaiah li. requires a more detailed account of this
mode of catching large animals, it will be as well to describe
the sport as at present practised in the East.</p>

<p>When a king or some wealthy man determines to hunt game
without taking much trouble himself, he gives orders to his men
to prepare their nets, which vary in size or strength according to
the particular animal for which they are intended. If, for example,
only the wild boar and similar animals are to be hunted,
the nets need not be of very great width; but for agile creatures,
such as the antelope, they must be exceedingly wide, or the
intended prey will leap over them. As the net is much used in
India for the purpose of catching game, Captain Williamson's
description of it will explain many of the passages of Scripture
wherein it is mentioned.</p>

<p>The material of the net is hemp, twisted loosely into a kind
of rope, and the mode in which it is formed is rather peculiar.
The meshes are not knotted together, but only twisted round
each other, much after the fashion of the South American hammocks,
so as to obtain considerable elasticity, and to prevent a
powerful animal from snapping the cord in its struggles. Some
of these nets are thirteen feet or more in width, and even such
a net as this has been overleaped by a herd of antelopes. Their
length is variable, but, as they can be joined in any number when
set end to end, the length is not so important as the width.</p>

<p>The mode of setting the nets is singularly ingenious. When
a suitable spot has been selected, the first care of the hunters is
to stretch a rope as tightly as possible along the ground. For
this purpose stout wooden stakes or truncheons are sunk crosswise
in the earth, and between these the rope is carefully
strained. The favourite locality of the net is a ravine, through
which the animals can be driven so as to run against the net in
their efforts to escape, and across the ravine a whole row of
these stakes is sunk. The net is now brought to the spot,
and its lower edge fastened strongly to the ground rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The strength of this mode of fastening is astonishing, and,
although the stakes are buried scarcely a foot below the surface,
they cannot be torn up by any force which can be applied to
them; and, however strong the rope may be, it would be broken
before the stakes could be dragged out of the ground.</p>

<p>A smaller rope is now attached to the upper edge of the
net, which is raised upon a series of slight poles. It is not
stretched quite tightly, but droops between each pair of poles,
so that a net which is some thirteen feet in width will only give
nine or ten feet of clear height when the upper edge is supported
on the poles. These latter are not fixed in the ground,
but merely held in their places by the weight of the net resting
upon them.</p>

<p>When the nets have been properly set, the beaters make a
wide circuit through the country, gradually advancing towards
the fatal spot, and driving before them all the wild animals that
inhabit the neighbourhood. As soon as any large beast, such,
for example, as an antelope, strikes against the net, the supporting
pole falls, and the net collapses upon the unfortunate animal,
whose struggles&mdash;especially if he be one of the horned animals&mdash;only
entangle him more and more in the toils.</p>

<p>As soon as the hunters see a portion of the net fall, they run
to the spot, kill the helpless creature that lies enveloped in the
elastic meshes, drag away the body, and set up the net again
in readiness for the next comer. Sometimes the line of nets
will extend for half a mile or more, and give employment to a
large staff of hunters, in killing the entangled animals, and
raising afresh those portions of the net which had fallen.</p>

<p>Accepting the theory that the Tô is one of the large antelopes
that inhabit, or used to inhabit, the Holy Land and its neighbourhood,
we may safely conjecture that it may signify the
beautiful animal known as the <span class="smcap">Oryx</span> (<em>Oryx leucoryx</em>), an animal
which has a tolerably wide range, and is even now found on the
borders of the Holy Land. It is a large and powerful antelope,
and is remarkable for its beautiful horns, which sometimes
exceed a yard in length, and sweep in a most graceful curve over
the back.</p>

<p>Sharp as they are, and evidently formidable weapons, the
manner in which they are set on the head renders them apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
unserviceable for combat. When, however, the Oryx is
brought to bay, or wishes to fight, it stoops its head until the
nose is close to the ground, the points of the horns being thus
brought to the front. As the head is swung from side to side,
the curved horns sweep through a considerable space, and are so
formidable that even the lion is chary of attacking their owner.
Indeed, instances are known where the lion has been transfixed
and killed by the horns of the Oryx. Sometimes the animal
is not content with merely standing to repel the attacks of its
adversaries, but suddenly charges forward with astonishing rapidity,
and strikes upwards with its horns as it makes the leap.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="wild" id="wild"></a>
<img src="images/i_154.jpg" width="450" height="516" alt="wild" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WILD BULL, OR ORYX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But these horns, which can be used with such terrible effect
in battle, are worse than useless when the animal is hampered
in the net. In vain does the Oryx attempt its usual defence:
the curved horns get more and more entangled in the elastic
meshes, and become a source of weakness rather than strength.
We see now how singularly appropriate is the passage, "Thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sons lie at the heads of all the streets, as a wild bull (or Oryx)
in a net," and how completely the force of the metaphor is lost
without a knowledge of the precise mode of fixing the nets, of
driving the animals into them, and of the manner in which they
render even the large and powerful animals helpless.</p>

<p>The height of the Oryx at the shoulder is between three and
four feet, and its colour is greyish white, mottled profusely with
black and brown in bold patches. It is plentiful in Northern
Africa, and, like many other antelopes, lives in herds, so that it
is peculiarly suited to that mode of hunting which consists in
surrounding a number of animals, and driving them into a trap
of some kind, whether a fenced enclosure, a pitfall, or a net.</p>

<p>There is, by the way, the term "snare," which is specially
used with especial reference to catching the foot as distinguished
from the net which enveloped the whole body. For example,
in Job xviii. 8, "He is cast into a net, he walketh on a snare,"
where a bold distinction is drawn between the two and their
mode of action. And in ver. 10, "The snare is laid for him in
the ground." Though I would not state definitely that such is
the case, I believe that the snare which is here mentioned is one
which is still used in several parts of the world.</p>

<p>It is simply a hoop, to the inner edge of which are fastened
a number of elastic spikes, the points being directed towards the
centre. This is merely laid in the path which the animal will
take, and is tied by a short cord to a log of wood. As the deer
or antelope treads on the snare, the foot passes easily through
the elastic spikes, but, when the foot is raised, the spikes run
into the joint and hold the hoop upon the limb. Terrified by
the check and the sudden pang, the animal tries to run away,
but, by the united influence of sharp spikes and the heavy log,
it is soon forced to halt, and so becomes an easy prey to its
pursuers.</p>

<p>There are many animals mentioned in the Scriptures
which are identified with difficulty, partly because their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
names occur only once or twice in the sacred writings, and
partly because, when they are mentioned, the context affords no
clue to their identity by giving any hint as to their appearance
or habits. In such cases, although the translators would have
done better if they had simply given the Hebrew word without
endeavouring to identify it with any known animal, they may
be excused for committing errors in their nomenclature. There
is one animal, however, for which no such excuse can be found,
and this is the Reêm of Scripture, translated as Unicorn in the
authorized version.</p>

<p>Even in late years the Unicorn has been erroneously supposed
to be identical with the Rhinoceros of India. It is, however, now
certain that the Unicorn was not the Rhinoceros, and that it can
be almost certainly identified with an animal which, at the time
when the passages in question were written, was plentiful in Palestine,
although, like the Lion, it is now extinct.</p>

<p>On turning to the Jewish Bible we find that the word Reêm
is translated as buffalo, and there is no doubt that this rendering
is nearly the correct one. At the present day naturalists are
nearly all agreed that the Unicorn of the Old Testament must
have been of the Ox tribe. Probably the Urus, a species now
extinct, was the animal alluded to. A smaller animal, the Bonassus
or Bison, also existed in Palestine, and even to the present day
continues to maintain itself in one or two spots, though it will
probably be as soon completely erased from the surface of the
earth as its gigantic congener.</p>

<p>That the Unicorn was one of the two animals is certain, and
that it was the larger is nearly as certain. The reason for deciding
upon the Urus is, that its horns were of great size and
strength, and therefore agree with the description of the Unicorn;
whereas those of the Bonassus, although powerful, are short, and
not conspicuous enough to deserve the notice which is taken of
them by the sacred writers.</p>

<p>Of the extinct variety we know but little. We do know, however,
that it was a huge and most formidable beast, as is evident
from the skulls and other bones which have been discovered.
Their character also indicates that the creature was nothing more
than a very large Ox, probably measuring twelve feet in length,
and six feet in height. Such a wild animal, armed, as it was, with
enormous horns, would prove a most formidable antagonist.</p>

<h2>THE BISON.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Bison tribe and its distinguishing marks&mdash;Its former existence in Palestine&mdash;Its
general habits&mdash;Origin of its name&mdash;Its musky odour&mdash;Size and speed of
the Bison&mdash;Its dangerous character when brought to bay&mdash;Its defence against
the wolf&mdash;Its untameable disposition.</p></blockquote>


<p>A few words are now needful respecting the second animal
which has been mentioned in connexion with the Reêm; namely,
the Bison, or Bonassus. The Bisons are distinguishable from
ordinary cattle by the thick and heavy mane which covers the
neck and shoulders, and which is more conspicuous in the male
than in the female. The general coating of the body is also
rather different, being thick and woolly instead of lying closely
to the skin like that of the other oxen. The Bison certainly
inhabited Palestine, as its bones have been found in that
country. It has, however, been extinct in the Holy Land for
many years, and, not being an animal that is capable of withstanding
the encroachments of man, it has gradually died out
from the greater part of Europe and Asia, and is now to be
found only in a very limited locality, chiefly in a Lithuanian
forest, where it is strictly preserved, and in some parts of the
Caucasus. There it still preserves the habits which made its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ancient and gigantic relative so dangerous an animal. Unlike
the buffalo, which loves the low-lying and marshy lands, the
Bison prefers the high wooded localities, where it lives in small
troops.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="killing" id="killing"></a>
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="450" height="524" alt="killing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BISON KILLING WOLF.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Its name of Bison is a modification of the word Bisam, or
musk, which was given to it on account of the strong musky
odour of its flesh, which is especially powerful about the head
and neck. This odour is not so unpleasant as might be supposed,
and those who have had personal experience of the
animal say that it bears some resemblance to the perfume of
violets. It is developed most strongly in the adult bulls, the
cows and young male calves only possessing it in a slight
degree.</p>

<p>It is a tolerably large animal, being about six feet high at the
shoulder&mdash;a stature nearly equivalent to that of the ordinary
Asiatic elephant; and, in spite of its great bulk, is a fleet and
active animal, as indeed is generally the case with those oxen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
which inhabit elevated localities. Still, though it can run with
considerable speed, it is not able to keep up the pace for any
great distance, and at the end of a mile or two can be brought
to bay.</p>

<p>Like most animals, however large and powerful they may be,
it fears the presence of man, and, if it sees or scents a human
being, will try to slip quietly away; but when it is baffled in
this attempt, and forced to fight, it becomes a fierce and dangerous
antagonist, charging with wonderful quickness, and using
its short and powerful horns with great effect. A wounded
Bison, when fairly brought to bay, is perhaps as awkward an
opponent as can be found, and to kill it without the aid of firearms
is no easy matter.</p>

<p>Although the countries in which it lives are infested with
wolves, it seems to have no fear of them when in health; and,
even when pressed by their winter's hunger, the wolves do not
venture to attack even a single Bison, much less a herd of them.
Like other wild cattle, it likes to dabble in muddy pools, and is
fond of harbouring in thickets near such localities; and those
who have to travel through the forest keep clear of such spots,
unless they desire to drive out the animal for the purpose of
killing it.</p>

<p>Like the extinct Aurochs, the Bison has never been domesticated,
and, although the calves have been captured while very
young, and attempts have been made to train them to harness,
their innate wildness of disposition has always baffled such
efforts.</p>

<h2>THE GAZELLE, OR ROE OF SCRIPTURE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Its swiftness, its beauty, and the quality of its flesh&mdash;Different varieties of the
Gazelle&mdash;How the Gazelle defends itself against wild beasts&mdash;Chase of the
Gazelle.</p></blockquote>


<p>We now leave the Ox tribe, and come to the Antelopes, several
species of which are mentioned in the Scriptures. Four kinds
of antelope are found in or near the Holy Land, and there is
little doubt that all of them are mentioned in the sacred volume.</p>

<p>The first that will be described is the <span class="smcap">Gazelle</span>, which is acknowledged
to be the animal that is represented by the word
<em>Tsebi</em>, or <em>Tsebiyah</em>. The Jewish Bible accepts the same rendering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
This word occurs many times, sometimes as a metaphor, and
sometimes representing some animal which was lawful food, and
which therefore belonged to the true ruminants. Moreover, its
flesh was not only legally capable of being eaten, but was held
in such estimation that it was provided for the table of Solomon
himself, together with other animals which will be described in
their turn.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="gazelles" id="gazelles"></a>
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="450" height="518" alt="gazelles" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GAZELLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is even now considered a great dainty, although it is not at
all agreeable to European taste, being hard, dry, and without
flavour. Still, as has been well remarked, tastes differ as well
as localities, and an article of food which is a costly luxury in
one land is utterly disdained in another, and will hardly be eaten
except by one who is absolutely dying of starvation.</p>

<p>The Gazelle is very common in Palestine in the present day,
and, in the ancient times, must have been even more plentiful.
There are several varieties of it, which were once thought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
distinct species, but are now acknowledged to be mere varieties,
all of which are referable to the single species <em>Gazella Dorcas</em>.
There is, for example, the Corinna, or Corine Antelope, which is
a rather boldly-spotted female; the Kevella Antelope, in which
the horns are slightly flattened; the small variety called the
Ariel, or Cora; the grey Kevel, which is a rather large variety;
and the Long-horned Gazelle, which owes its name to a rather
large development of the horns.</p>

<p>Whatever variety may inhabit any given spot, they all have
the same habits. They are gregarious animals, associating
together in herds often of considerable size, and deriving from
their numbers an element of strength which would otherwise be
wanting. Against mankind, numbers are of no avail; but when
the agile though feeble Gazelle has to defend itself against the
predatory animals of its own land, it can only defend itself
by the concerted action of the whole herd. Should, for example,
the wolves prowl round a herd of Gazelles, after their treacherous
wont, the Gazelles instantly assume a posture of self-defence.
They form themselves into a compact phalanx, all the males
coming to the front, and the strongest and boldest taking on
themselves the honourable duty of facing the foe. The does
and the young are kept within their ranks, and so formidable is
the array of sharp, menacing horns, that beasts as voracious as
the wolf, and far more powerful, have been known to retire
without attempting to charge.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, the Gazelle does not desire to resist, and
prefers its legs to its horns as a mode of insuring safety. So
fleet is the animal, that it seems to fly over the ground as if
propelled by volition alone, and its light, agile frame is so enduring,
that a fair chase has hardly any prospect of success.
Hunters, therefore, prefer a trap of some kind, if they chase
the animal merely for food or for the sake of its skin, and contrive
to kill considerable numbers at once. Sometimes they
dig pitfalls, and drive the Gazelles into them by beating a large
tract of country, and gradually narrowing the circle. Sometimes
they use nets, such as have already been described, and sometimes
they line the sides of a ravine with archers and spearmen,
and drive the herd of Gazelles through the treacherous defile.</p>

<p>These modes of slaughter are, however, condemned by the
true hunter, who looks upon those who use them much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
same light as an English sportsman looks on a man who shoots
foxes. The greyhound and the falcon are both employed in the
legitimate capture of the Gazelle, and in some cases both are
trained to work together. Hunting the Gazelle with the greyhound
very much resembles coursing in our own country, and
chasing it with the hawk is exactly like the system of falconry
that was once so popular an English sport, and which even now
shows signs of revival.</p>

<p>It is, however, when the dog and the bird are trained to work
together that the spectacle becomes really novel and interesting
to an English spectator.</p>

<p>As soon as the Gazelles are fairly in view, the hunter unhoods
his hawk, and holds it up so that it may see the animals. The
bird fixes its eye on one Gazelle, and by that glance the animal's
doom is settled. The falcon darts after the Gazelles, followed by
the dog, who keeps his eye on the hawk, and holds himself in
readiness to attack the animal that his feathered ally may select.
Suddenly the falcon, which has been for some few seconds
hovering over the herd of Gazelles, makes a stoop upon the
selected victim, fastening its talons in its forehead, and, as it
tries to shake off its strange foe, flaps its wings into the Gazelle's
eyes so as to blind it. Consequently, the rapid course of the
antelope is arrested, so that the dog is able to come up and
secure the animal while it is struggling to escape from its
feathered enemy. Sometimes, though rarely, a young and inexperienced
hawk swoops down with such reckless force that it
misses the forehead of the Gazelle, and impales itself upon the
sharp horns, just as in England the falcon is apt to be spitted
on the bill of the heron.</p>

<p>The most sportsmanlike mode of hunting the Gazelle is to use
the falcon alone; but for this sport a bird must possess exceptional
strength, swiftness, and intelligence. A very spirited
account of such a chase is given by Mr. G. W. Chasseaud, in his
"Druses of the Lebanon:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whilst reposing here, our old friend with the falcon informs
us that at a short distance from this spot is a khan called Nebbi
Youni, from a supposition that the prophet Jonah was here
landed by the whale; but the old man is very indignant when
we identify the place with a fable, and declare to him that
similar sights are to be seen at Gaza and Scanderoon. But his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
good humour is speedily recovered by reverting to the subject
of the exploits and cleverness of his falcon. This reminds him
that we have not much time to waste in idle talk, as the greater
heats will drive the gazelles from the plains to the mountain
retreats, and lose us the opportunity of enjoying the most
sportsmanlike amusement in Syria. Accordingly, bestriding our
animals again, we ford the river at that point where a bridge
once stood.</p>

<p>"We have barely proceeded twenty minutes before the keen
eye of the falconer has descried a herd of gazelles quietly grazing
in the distance. Immediately he reins in his horse, and enjoining
silence, instead of riding at them, as we might have felt inclined
to do, he skirts along the banks of the river, so as to cut off, if
possible, the retreat of these fleet animals where the banks are
narrowest, though very deep, but which would be cleared at a
single leap by the gazelles. Having successfully accomplished
this man&oelig;uvre, he again removes the hood from the hawk, and
indicates to us that precaution is no longer necessary. Accordingly,
first adding a few slugs to the charges in our barrels, we
balance our guns in an easy posture, and, giving the horses
their reins, set off at full gallop, and with a loud hurrah, right
towards the already startled gazelles.</p>

<p>"The timid animals, at first paralysed by our appearance,
stand and gaze for a second terror-stricken at our approach; but
their pause is only momentary; they perceive in an instant that
the retreat to their favourite haunts has been secured, and so
they dash wildly forward with all the fleetness of despair,
coursing over the plain with no fixed refuge in view, and nothing
but their fleetness to aid in their delivery. A stern chase is a
long chase, and so, doubtless, on the present occasion it would
prove with ourselves, for there is many and many a mile of
level country before us, and our horses, though swift of foot,
stand no chance in this respect with the gazelles.</p>

<p>"Now, however, the old man has watched for a good opportunity
to display the prowess and skill of his falcon: he has
followed us only at a hand-gallop; but the hawk, long inured to
such pastime, stretches forth its neck eagerly in the direction of
the flying prey, and being loosened from its pinions, sweeps up
into the air like a shot, and passes overhead with incredible
velocity. Five minutes more, and the bird has outstripped even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the speed of the light-footed gazelle; we see him through the
dust and haze that our own speed throws around us, hovering
but an instant over the terrified herd; he has singled out his
prey, and, diving with unerring aim, fixes his iron talons into
the head of the terrified animal.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="falcon" id="falcon"></a>
<img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="400" height="562" alt="falcon" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE FALCON USED IN OUR HUNT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"This is the signal for the others to break up their orderly
retreat, and to speed over the plain in every direction. Some,
despite the danger that hovers on their track, make straight for
their old and familiar haunts, and passing within twenty yards
of where we ride, afford us an opportunity of displaying our
skill as amateur huntsmen on horseback; nor does it require
but little nerve and dexterity to fix our aim whilst our horses
are tearing over the ground. However, the moment presents
itself, the loud report of barrel after barrel startles the unaccustomed
inmates of that unfrequented waste; one gazelle leaps
twice its own height into the air, and then rolls over, shot
through the heart; another bounds on yet a dozen paces, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
wounded mortally, staggering, halts, and then falls to the
ground.</p>

<p>"This is no time for us to pull in and see what is the amount
of damage done, for the falcon, heedless of all surrounding
incidents, clings firmly to the head of its terrified victim, flapping
its strong wings awhile before the poor brute's terrified
eyes, half blinding it and rendering its head dizzy; till, after
tearing round and round with incredible speed, the poor creature
stops, panting for breath, and, overcome with excessive terror,
drops down fainting upon the earth. Now the air resounds with
the acclamations and hootings of the ruthless victors.</p>

<p>"The Arab is wild in his transports of delight. More certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of the prowess of his bird than ourselves, he had stopped
awhile to gather together the fruits of our booty, and now galloped
furiously up, waving his long gun, and shouting lustily
the while the praises of his infallible hawk; then getting down,
and hoodwinking the bird again, he first of all takes the
precaution of fastening together the legs of the fallen gazelle,
and then he humanely blows up into its nostrils. Gradually
the natural brilliancy returns to the dimmed eyes of the gazelle,
then it struggles valiantly, but vainly, to disentangle itself from
its fetters.</p>

<p>"Pitying its efforts, the falconer throws a handkerchief over
its head, and, securing this prize, claims it as his own, declaring
that he will bear it home to his house in the mountains, where,
after a few weeks' kind treatment and care, it will become as
domesticated and affectionate as a spaniel. Meanwhile, Abou
Shein gathers together the fallen booty, and, tying them securely
with cords, fastens them behind his own saddle, declaring, with
a triumphant laugh, that we shall return that evening to the
city of Beyrout with such game as few sportsmen can boast of
having carried thither in one day."</p>

<p>The gentle nature of the Gazelle is as proverbial as its grace
and swiftness, and is well expressed in the large, soft, liquid eye,
which has formed from time immemorial the stock comparison
of Oriental poets when describing the eyes of beauty.</p>

<h2>THE PYGARG, OR ADDAX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Dishon or Dyshon&mdash;Signification of the word Pygarg&mdash;Certainty that the
Dishon is an antelope, and that it must be one of a few species&mdash;Former and
present range of the Addax&mdash;Description of the Addax.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is a species of animal mentioned once in the Scriptures
under the name of Dishon which the Jewish Bible leaves
untranslated, and merely gives as Dyshon, and which is rendered
in the Septuagint by Pugargos, or <span class="smcap">Pygarg</span>, as one version gives
it. Now, the meaning of the word Pygarg is white-crouped,
and for that reason the Pygarg of the Scriptures is usually held
to be one of the white-crouped antelopes, of which several
species are known. Perhaps it may be one of them&mdash;it may
possibly be neither, and it may probably refer to all of them.</p>

<p>But that an antelope of some kind is meant by the word
Dishon is evident enough, and it is also evident that the Dishon
must have been one of the antelopes which could be obtained
by the Jews. Now as the species of antelope which could have
furnished food for that nation are very few in number, it is clear
that, even if we do not hit upon the exact species, we may be
sure of selecting an animal that was closely allied to it. Moreover,
as the nomenclature is exceedingly loose, it is probable
that more than one species might have been included in the
word Dishon.</p>

<p>Modern commentators have agreed that there is every probability
that the Dishon of the Pentateuch was the antelope
known by the name of Addax.</p>

<p>This handsome antelope is a native of Northern Africa. It
has a very wide range, and, even at the present day, is found in
the vicinity of Palestine, so that it evidently was one of the
antelopes which could be killed by Jewish hunters. From its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
large size, and long twisted horns, it bears a strong resemblance
to the Koodoo of Southern Africa. The horns, however, are not
so long, nor so boldly twisted, the curve being comparatively
slight, and not possessing the bold spiral shape which distinguishes
those of the koodoo.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="addax" id="addax"></a>
<img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="450" height="496" alt="addax" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ADDAX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ordinary height of the Addax is three feet seven or eight
inches, and the horns are almost exactly alike in the two sexes.
Their length, from the head to the tips, is rather more than two
feet. Its colour is mostly white, but a thick mane of dark black
hair falls from the throat, a patch of similar hair grows on the
forehead, and the back and shoulders are greyish brown. There
is no mane on the back of the neck, as is the case with the
koodoo.</p>

<p>The Addax is a sand-loving animal, as is shown by the wide
and spreading hoofs, which afford it a firm footing on the yielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
soil. In all probability, this is one of the animals which would be
taken, like the wild bull, in a net, being surrounded and driven
into the toils by a number of hunters. It is not, however, one of
the gregarious species, and is not found in those vast herds in
which some of the antelopes love to assemble.</p>

<h2>THE FALLOW-DEER, OR BUBALE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The word Jachmur evidently represents a species of antelope&mdash;Resemblance of the
animal to the ox tribe&mdash;Its ox-like horns and mode of attack&mdash;Its capability
of domestication&mdash;Former and present range of the Bubale&mdash;Its representation
on the monuments of ancient Egypt&mdash;Delicacy of its flesh&mdash;Size and general
appearance of the animal.</p></blockquote>


<p>It has already been mentioned that in the Old Testament
there occur the names of three or four animals, which clearly
belong to one or other of three or four antelopes. Only
one of these names now remains to be identified. This is
the Jachmur, or Yachmur, a word which has been rendered in
the Septuagint as Boubalos, and has been translated in our
Authorized Version as <span class="smcap">Fallow Deer</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall presently see that the Fallow Deer is to be identified
with another animal, and that the word Jachmur must find
another interpretation. If we follow the Septuagint, and call
it the <span class="smcap">Bubale</span>, we shall identify it with a well-known antelope
called by the Arabs the "Bekk'r-el-Wash," and known to
zoologists as the <span class="smcap">Bubale</span> (<em>Acronotus bubalis</em>).</p>

<p>This fine antelope would scarcely be recognised as such by
an unskilled observer, as in its general appearance it much more
resembles the ox tribe than the antelope. Indeed, the Arabic
title, "Bekk'r-el-Wash," or Wild Cow, shows how close must be
the resemblance to the oxen. The Arabs, and indeed all the
Orientals in whose countries it lives, believe it not to be an antelope,
but one of the oxen, and class it accordingly.</p>

<p>How much the appearance of the Bubale justifies them in
this opinion may be judged by reference to the figure on page
143. The horns are thick, short, and heavy, and are first
inclined forwards, and then rather suddenly bent backwards.
This formation of the horns causes the Bubale to use his weapons
after the manner of the bull, thereby increasing the resemblance
between them. When it attacks, the Bubale lowers its head to
the ground, and as soon as its antagonist is within reach, tosses
its head violently upwards, or swings it with a sidelong upward
blow. In either case, the sharp curved horns, impelled by the
powerful neck of the animal, and assisted by the weight of the
large head, become most formidable weapons.</p>

<p>It is said that in some places, where the Bubales have learned
to endure the presence of man, they will mix with his herds for
the sake of feeding with them, and by degrees become so accustomed
to the companionship of their domesticated friends, that
they live with the herd as if they had belonged to it all their
lives. This fact shows that the animal possesses a gentle disposition,
and it is said to be as easily tamed as the gazelle
itself.</p>

<p>Even at the present day the Bubale has a very wide range,
and formerly had in all probability a much wider. It is indigenous
to Barbary, and has continued to spread itself over the
greater part of Northern Africa, including the borders of the
Sahara, the edges of the cultivated districts, and up the Nile
for no small distance. In former days it was evidently a tolerably
common animal of chase in Upper Egypt as there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
representations of it on the monuments, drawn with the quaint
truthfulness which distinguishes the monumental sculpture of
that period.</p>

<p>It is probable that in and about Palestine it was equally
common, so that there is good reason why it should be specially
named as one of the animals that were lawful food. Not only was
its flesh permitted to be eaten, but it was evidently considered
as a great dainty, inasmuch as the Jachmur is mentioned in
1 Kings iv. 23 as one of the animals which were brought to
the royal table. "Harts and Roebucks and Fallow-Deer" are
the wild animals mentioned in the passage alluded to.</p>

<p>We now come to a subject which will necessarily occupy us for
some little time.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no animal which occupies a larger space in
the Scriptures than the <span class="smcap">Sheep</span>. Whether in religious, civil, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
domestic life, we find that the Sheep is bound up with the
Jewish nation in a way that would seem almost incomprehensible,
did we not recall the light which the New Testament
throws upon the Old, and the many allusions to the coming
Messiah under the figure of the Lamb that taketh away the sins
of the world.</p>

<p>In treating of the Sheep, it will be perhaps advisable to
begin the account by taking the animal simply as one of those
creatures which have been domesticated from time immemorial,
dwelling slightly on those points on which the sheep-owners of
the old days differed from those of our own time.</p>

<p>The only claim to the land seems, in the old times of the
Scriptures, to have lain in cultivation, or perhaps in the land
immediately surrounding a well. But any one appears to have
taken a piece of ground and cultivated it, or to have dug a well
wherever he chose, and thereby to have acquired a sort of right
to the soil. The same custom prevails at the present day among
the cattle-breeding races of Southern Africa. The banks of
rivers, on account of their superior fertility, were considered as
the property of the chiefs who lived along their course, but the
inland soil was free to all.</p>

<p>Had it not been for this freedom of the land, it would have
been impossible for the great men to have nourished the enormous
flocks and herds of which their wealth consisted; but, on
account of the lack of ownership of the soil, a flock could be
moved to one district after another as fast as it exhausted the
herbage, the shepherds thus unconsciously imitating the habits
of the gregarious animals, which are always on the move from
one spot to another.</p>

<p>Pasturage being thus free to all, Sheep had a higher comparative
value than is the case with ourselves, who have to pay in
some way for their keep. There is a proverb in the Talmud
which may be curtly translated, "Land sell, sheep buy."</p>

<p>The value of a good pasture-ground for the flocks is so great,
that its possession is well worth a battle, the shepherds being
saved from a most weary and harassing life, and being moreover
fewer in number than is needed when the pasturage is scanty
Sir S. Baker, in his work on Abyssinia, makes some very interesting
remarks upon the Arab herdsmen, who are placed in
conditions very similar to those of the Israelitish shepherds.</p>

</div>

<p>"The Arabs are creatures of necessity; their nomadic life is
compulsory, as the existence of their flocks and herds depends
upon the pasturage. Thus, with the change of seasons they
must change their localities according to the presence of fodder
for their cattle.... The Arab cannot halt in one spot longer
than the pasturage will support his flocks. The object of his
life being fodder, he must wander in search of the ever-changing
supply. His wants must be few, as the constant change of encampment
necessitates the transport of all his household goods;
thus he reduces to a minimum his domestic furniture and
utensils....</p>

<p>"This striking similarity to the descriptions of the Old Testament
is exceedingly interesting to a traveller when residing
among these curious and original people. With the Bible in
one's hand, and these unchanged tribes before the eyes, there is a
thrilling illustration of the sacred record; the past becomes the
present, the veil of three thousand years is raised, and the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
picture is a witness to the exactness of the historical description.
At the same time there is a light thrown upon many
obscure passages in the Old Testament by the experience of the
present customs and figures of speech of the Arabs, which are
precisely those that were practised at the periods described....</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">VIEW OF THE PYRAMIDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Should the present history of the country be written by an
Arab scribe, the style of the description would be precisely
that of the Old Testament. There is a fascination in the
unchangeable features of the Nile regions. There are the vast
pyramids that have defied time, the river upon which Moses was
cradled in infancy, the same sandy desert through which he led
his people, and the watering-places where their flocks were led
to drink. The wild and wandering Arabs, who thousands of
years ago dug out the wells in the wilderness, are represented by
their descendants, unchanged, who now draw water from the
deep wells of their forefathers, with the skins that have never
altered their fashion.</p>

<p>"The Arabs, gathering with their goats and sheep around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
wells to-day, recall the recollection of that distant time when
'Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
people of the east. And he looked, and behold a well in the
field, and lo! there were three flocks of sheep lying by it,' &amp;c.
The picture of that scene would be an illustration of Arab daily
life in the Nubian deserts, where the present is a mirror of the
past."</p>

<p>Owing to the great number of Sheep which they have to
tend, and the peculiar state of the country, the life of the shepherd
in Palestine is even now very different from that of an
English shepherd, and in the days of the early Scriptures the
distinction was even more distinctly marked.</p>

<p>Sheep had to be tended much more carefully than we generally
think. In the first place, a thoughtful shepherd had always
one idea before his mind,&mdash;namely, the possibility of obtaining
sufficient water for his flocks. Even pasturage is less important
than water, and, however tempting a district might be, no shepherd
would venture to take his charge there if he were not sure
of obtaining water. In a climate such as ours, this ever-pressing
anxiety respecting water can scarcely be appreciated, for in hot
climates not only is water scarce, but it is needed far more than
in a temperate and moist climate. Thirst does its work with
terrible quickness, and there are instances recorded where men
have sat down and died of thirst in sight of the river which
they had not strength to reach.</p>

<p>In places therefore through which no stream runs, the wells
are the great centres of pasturage, around which are to be seen
vast flocks extending far in every direction. These wells are
kept carefully closed by their owners, and are only opened for
the use of those who are entitled to water their flocks at
them.</p>

<p>Noontide is the general time for watering the Sheep, and
towards that hour all the flocks may be seen converging towards
their respective wells, the shepherd at the head of each flock, and
the Sheep following him. See how forcible becomes the imagery
of David, the shepherd poet, "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall
not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures (or, in
pastures of tender grass): He leadeth me beside the still waters"
(Ps. xxiii. 1, 2). Here we have two of the principal duties of
the good shepherd brought prominently before us,&mdash;namely, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
guiding of the Sheep to green pastures and leading them to fresh
water. Very many references are made in the Scriptures to the
pasturage of sheep, both in a technical and a metaphorical sense;
but as our space is limited, and these passages are very numerous,
only one or two of each will be taken.</p>

<p>In the story of Joseph, we find that when his father and
brothers were suffering from the famine, they seem to have cared
as much for their Sheep and cattle as for themselves, inasmuch as
among a pastoral people the flocks and herds constitute the only
wealth. So, when Joseph at last discovered himself, and his
family were admitted to the favour of Pharaoh, the first request
which they made was for their flocks. "Pharaoh said unto his
brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto
Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our
fathers.</p>

<p>"They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land
are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we
pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."</p>

<p>This one incident, so slightly remarked in the sacred history,
gives a wonderfully clear notion of the sort of life led by Jacob
and his sons. Forming, according to custom, a small tribe of
their own, of which the father was the chief, they led a pastoral
life, taking their continually increasing herds and flocks from
place to place as they could find food for them. For example, at
the memorable time when the story of Joseph begins, he was
sent by his father to his brothers, who were feeding the flocks,
and he wandered about for some time, not knowing where to
find them. It may seem strange that he should be unable to
discover such very conspicuous objects as large flocks of sheep
and goats, but the fact is that they had been driven from one
pasture-land to another, and had travelled in search of food all
the way from Shechem to Dothan.</p>

<p>In 1 Chron. iv. 39, 40, we read of the still pastoral Israelites
that "they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east
side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. And they
found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet,
and peaceable."</p>

<p>How it came to be quiet and peaceable is told in the context.
It was peaceable simply because the Israelites were attracted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the good pasturage, attacked the original inhabitants, and exterminated
them so effectually that none were left to offer resistance
to the usurpers. And we find from this passage that the value
of good pasture-land where the Sheep could feed continually
without being forced to wander from one spot to another was
so considerable, that the owners of the flocks engaged in war,
and exposed their own lives, in order to obtain so valuable a
possession.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JACOB MEETS RACHEL AT THE WELL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We will now look at one or two of the passages that mention
watering the Sheep&mdash;a duty so imperative on an Oriental shepherd,
and so needless to our own.</p>

<p>In the first place we find that most graphic narrative which
occurs in Gen. xxix. to which a passing reference has already
been made. When Jacob was on his way from his parents to
the home of Laban in Padan-aram, he came upon the very well
which belonged to his uncle, and there saw three flocks of Sheep
lying around the well, waiting until the proper hour arrived.
According to custom, a large stone was laid over the well, so as
to perform the double office of keeping out the sand and dust,
and of guarding the precious water against those who had no
right to it. And when he saw his cousin Rachel arrive with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a><br /><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the flock of which she had the management, he, according to the
courtesy of the country and the time, rolled away the ponderous
barrier, and poured out water into the troughs for the Sheep
which Rachel tended.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 330px;"><a name="western" id="western"></a>
<img src="images/i_182.jpg" width="330" height="600" alt="eastern" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">EASTERN SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>About two hundred years afterwards, we find Moses performing
a similar act. When he was obliged to escape into
Midian on account of his fatal quarrel with a tyrannical
Egyptian, he sat down by a well, waiting for the time when the
stone might be rolled away, and the water be distributed. Now
it happened that this well belonged to Jethro, the chief priest of
the country, whose wealth consisted principally of Sheep. He
entrusted his flock to the care of his seven daughters, who led
their Sheep to the well and drew water as usual into the troughs.
Presuming on their weakness, other shepherds came and tried
to drive them away, but were opposed by Moses, who drove
them away, and with his own hands watered the flock.</p>

<p>Now in both these examples we find that the men who
performed the courteous office of drawing the water and pouring
it into the sheep-troughs married afterwards the girl to whose
charge the flocks had been committed. This brings us to the
Oriental custom which has been preserved to the present day.</p>

<p>The wells at which the cattle are watered at noon-day are the
meeting-places of the tribe, and it is chiefly at the well that the
young men and women meet each other. As each successive
flock arrives at the well, the number of the people increases,
and while the sheep and goats lie patiently round the water,
waiting for the time when the last flock shall arrive, and the
stone be rolled off the mouth of the well, the gossip of the tribe
is discussed, and the young people have ample opportunity for
the pleasing business of courtship.</p>

<p>As to the passages in which the wells, rivers, brooks, water-springs,
are spoken of in a metaphorical sense, they are too
numerous to be quoted.</p>

<p>And here I may observe, that in reality the whole of Scripture
has its symbolical as well as its outward signification; and that,
until we have learned to read the Bible strictly according to the
spirit, we cannot understand one-thousandth part of the mysteries
which it conceals behind its veil of language; nor can we
appreciate one-thousandth part of the treasures of wisdom which
lie hidden in its pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Another duty of the shepherd of ancient Palestine was to
guard his flock from depredators, whether man or beast.
Therefore the shepherd was forced to carry arms; to act as a
sentry during the night; and, in fact, to be a sort of irregular
soldier. A fully-armed shepherd had with him his bow, his
spear, and his sword, and not even a shepherd lad was without
his sling and the great quarter-staff which is even now universally
carried by the tribes along the Nile&mdash;a staff as thick as a man's
wrist, and six or seven feet in length. He was skilled in the
use of all these weapons, especially in that of the sling.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="david" id="david"></a>
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="450" height="356" alt="david" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DAVID GATHERS STONES FROM THE BROOK TO CAST AT GOLIATH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In these days, the sling is only considered as a mere toy,
whereas, before the introduction of fire-arms, it was one of the
most formidable weapons that could be wielded by light troops.
Round and smooth stones weighing three or four ounces were
the usual projectiles, and, by dint of constant practice from
childhood, the slingers could aim with a marvellous precision.
Of this fact we have a notable instance in David, who knew
that the sling and the five stones in the hand of an active youth
unencumbered by armour, and wearing merely the shepherd's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
simple tunic, were more than a match for all the ponderous
weapons of the gigantic Philistine.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been the fashion to attribute the successful
aim of David to a special miracle, whereas those who are
acquainted with ancient weapons know well that no miracle was
wrought, because none was needed; a good slinger at that time
being as sure of his aim as a good rifleman of our days.</p>

<p>The sling was in constant requisition, being used both in
directing the Sheep and in repelling enemies: a stone skilfully
thrown in front of a straying Sheep being a well-understood
signal that the animal had better retrace its steps if it did not
want to feel the next stone on its back.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN EASTERN SHEPHERD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Passing his whole life with his flock, the shepherd was identified
with his Sheep far more than is the case in this country.
He knew all his Sheep by sight, he called them all by their
names, and they all knew him and recognised his voice. He
did not drive them, but he led them, walking in their front,
and they following him. Sometimes he would play with them,
pretending to run away while they pursued him, exactly as an
infant-school teacher plays with the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Consequently, they looked upon him as their protector as
well as their feeder, and were sure to follow wherever he led
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="following" id="following"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SHEEP FOLLOWING THEIR SHEPHERD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We must all remember how David, who had passed all his
early years as a shepherd, speaks of God as the Shepherd of
Israel, and the people as Sheep; never mentioning the Sheep as
being driven, but always as being led. "Thou leddest Thy
people like a flock, by the hands of Moses and Aaron" (Ps.
lxxvii. 20); "The Lord is my Shepherd.... He leadeth me
beside the still waters" (Ps. xxiii. 1, 2); "Lead me in a plain
path, because of mine enemies" (Ps. xxvii. 11); together with
many other passages too numerous to be quoted.</p>

<p>Our Lord Himself makes a familiar use of the same image:
"He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the shepherds of our own country know their Sheep
by sight, and say that there is as much difference in the faces
of Sheep as of men, they have not, as a rule, attained the art of
teaching their Sheep to recognise their names. This custom,
however, is still retained, as may be seen from a well-known
passage in Hartley's "Researches in Greece and the Levant:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having had my attention directed last night to the words in
John x. 3, I asked my man if it were usual in Greece to give
names to the sheep. He informed me that it was, and that
the sheep obeyed the shepherd when he called them by their
names. This morning I had an opportunity of verifying the
truth of this remark. Passing by a flock of sheep, I asked the
shepherd the same question which I had put to the servant, and
he gave me the same answer. I then bade him call one of his
sheep. He did so, and it instantly left its pasturage and its
companions, and ran up to the hands of the shepherd, with
signs of pleasure, and with a prompt obedience which I had never
before observed in any other animal.</p>

<p>"It is also true that in this country, 'a stranger will they not
follow, but will flee from him.' The shepherd told me that
many of his sheep were still wild, that they had not learned
their names, but that by teaching them they would all learn
them."</p>

<p>Generally, the shepherd was either the proprietor of the flock,
or had at all events a share in it, of which latter arrangement
we find a well-known example in the bargain which Jacob made
with Laban, all the white Sheep belonging to his father-in-law,
and all the dark and spotted Sheep being his wages as shepherd.
Such a man was far more likely to take care of the Sheep than
if he were merely a paid labourer; especially in a country where
the life of a shepherd was a life of actual danger, and he might at
any time be obliged to fight against armed robbers, or to oppose
the wolf, the lion, or the bear. The combat of the shepherd
David with the last-mentioned animals has already been
noticed.</p>

<p>In allusion to the continual risks run by the Oriental shepherd,
our Lord makes use of the following well-known words:&mdash;"The
thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I
am come that they might have life, and have it more abundantly.
I am the Good Shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the sheep. But he that is an hireling, ... whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the
sheep. The hireling fleeth because he is an hireling, and careth
not for the sheep."</p>

<p>Owing to the continual moving of the Sheep, the shepherd
had very hard work during the lambing time, and was obliged
to carry in his arms the young lambs which were too feeble to
accompany their parents, and to keep close to him those Sheep
who were expected soon to become mothers. At that time of
year the shepherd might constantly be seen at the head of his
flock, carrying one or two lambs in his arms, accompanied by
their mothers.</p>

<p>In allusion to this fact Isaiah writes: "His reward is with
Him, and His work before Him. He shall feed His flock like
a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arms and carry
them in His bosom, and shall gently lead them that are with
young" (or, "that give suck," according to the marginal reading).
Here we have presented at once before us the good shepherd
who is no hireling, but owns the Sheep; and who therefore has
"his reward with him, and his work before him;" who bears
the tender lambs in his arms, or lays them in the folds of his
mantle, and so carries them in his bosom, and leads by his side
their yet feeble mothers.</p>

<p>Frequent mention is made of the folds in which the Sheep are
penned; and as these folds differed&mdash;and still differ&mdash;materially
from those of our own land, we shall miss the force of several
passages of Scripture if we do not understand their form, and the
materials of which they were built. Our folds consist merely of
hurdles, moveable at pleasure, and so low that a man can easily
jump over them, and so fragile that he can easily pull them
down. Moreover, the Sheep are frequently enclosed within the
fold while they are at pasture.</p>

<p>If any one should entertain such an idea of the Oriental fold,
he would not see the force of the well-known passage in which
our Lord compares the Church to a sheepfold, and Himself to
the door. "He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold,
but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of
the sheep. To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
voice.... All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers:
but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any
man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and
find pasture."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="pen" id="pen"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ANCIENT SHEEP PEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Had the fold here mentioned been a simple enclosure of
hurdles, such an image could not have been used. It is evident
that the fold to which allusion was made, and which was probably
in sight at the time when Jesus was disputing with
the Pharisees, was a structure of some pretensions; that it
had walls which a thief could only enter by climbing over
them&mdash;not by "breaking through" them, as in the case of a
mud-walled private house; and that it had a gate, which was
guarded by a watchman.</p>

<p>In fact, the fold was a solid and enduring building, made of
stone. Thus in Numbers xxxii. it is related that the tribes of
Reuben and Gad, who had great quantities of Sheep and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cattle, asked for the eastward side of Jordan as a pasture-ground,
promising to go and fight for the people, but previously
to build fortified cities for their families, and folds for their
cattle, the folds being evidently, like the cities, buildings of an
enduring nature.</p>

<p>In some places the folds are simply rock caverns, partly natural
and partly artificial, often enlarged by a stone wall built outside
it. It was the absence of these rock caverns on the east side of
Jordan that compelled the Reubenites and Gadites to build folds
for themselves, whereas on the opposite side places of refuge were
comparatively abundant.</p>

<p>See, for example, the well-known history related in 1 Sam.
xxiii.-xxiv. David and his miscellaneous band of warriors,
some six hundred in number, were driven out of the cities by
the fear of Saul, and were obliged to pass their time in the
wilderness, living in the "strong holds" (xxiii. 14, 19), which we
find immediately afterwards to be rock caves (ver. 25). These
caves were of large extent, being able to shelter these six
hundred warriors, and, on one memorable occasion, to conceal
them so completely as they stood along the sides, that Saul, who
had just come out of the open air, was not able to discern them
in the dim light, and David even managed to approach him
unseen, and cut off a portion of his outer robe.</p>

<p>That this particular cave was a sheepfold we learn from
xxiv. 2-4: "Then Saul took three thousand chosen men
out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the
rocks of the wild goats. And he came to the sheepcotes by
the way." Into these strongholds the Sheep are driven towards
nightfall, and, as the flocks converge towards their resting-place,
the bleatings of the sheep are almost deafening.</p>

<p>The shepherds as well as their flocks found shelter in these
caves, making them their resting-places while they were living
the strange, wild, pastoral life among the hills; and at the
present day many of the smaller caves and "holes of the rock"
exhibit the vestiges of human habitation in the shape of straw,
hay, and other dried herbage, which has been used for beds, just
as we now find the rude couches of the coast-guard men in the
cliff caves of our shores.</p>

<p>The dogs which are attached to the sheepfolds were, as they
are now, the faithful servants of man, although, as has already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
been related, they are not made the companions of man as is
the case with ourselves. Lean, gaunt, hungry, and treated with
but scant kindness, they are yet faithful guardians against the
attack of enemies. They do not, as do our sheepdogs, assist in
driving the flocks, because the Sheep are not driven, but led, but
they are invaluable as nocturnal sentries. Crouching together
outside the fold, in little knots of six or seven together, they
detect the approach of wild animals, and at the first sign of the
wolf or the jackal they bark out a defiance, and scare away the
invaders. It is strange that the old superstitious idea of their
uncleanness should have held its ground through so many tens
of centuries; but, down to the present day, the shepherd of
Palestine, though making use of the dog as a guardian of his
flock, treats the animal with utter contempt, not to say cruelty,
beating and kicking the faithful creature on the least provocation,
and scarcely giving it sufficient food to keep it alive.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Sheep are brought up by hand at home.
"House-lamb," as we call it, is even now common, and the
practice of house-feeding peculiar in the old Scriptural times.</p>

<p>We have an allusion to this custom in the well-known parable
of the prophet Nathan: "The poor man had nothing, save one
little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it
grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of
his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom,
and was unto him as a daughter" (2 Sam. xii. 3). A further,
though less distinct, allusion is made to this practice in Isaiah
vii. 21: "It shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
nourish a young cow, and two sheep."</p>

<p>How the Sheep thus brought up by hand were fattened may
be conjectured from the following passage in Mr. D. Urquhart's
valuable work on the Lebanon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the month of June, they buy from the shepherds, when
pasturage has become scarce and sheep are cheap, two or three
sheep; these they feed by hand. After they have eaten up the
old grass and the provender about the doors, they get vine
leaves, and, after the silkworms have begun to spin, mulberry
leaves. They purchase them on trial, and the test is appetite.
If a sheep does not feed well, they return it after three days.
To increase their appetite they wash them twice a day, morning
and evening, a care they never bestow on their own bodies.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the sheep's appetite does not come up to their standard,
they use a little gentle violence, folding for them forced leaf-balls
and introducing them into their mouths. The mulberry has the
property of making them fat and tender. At the end of four
months the sheep they had bought at eighty piastres will sell
for one hundred and forty, or will realize one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>"The sheep is killed, skinned, and hung up. The fat is then
removed; the flesh is cut from the bones, and hung up in the
sun. Meanwhile, the fat has been put in a cauldron on the fire,
and as soon as it has come to boil, the meat is laid on. The
proportion of the fat to the lean is as four to ten, eight 'okes'
fat and twenty lean. A little salt is added, it is simmered for
an hour, and then placed in jars for the use of the family during
the year.</p>

<p>"The large joints are separated and used first, as not fit for
keeping long. The fat, with a portion of the lean, chopped fine,
is what serves for cooking the 'bourgoul,' and is called <em>Dehen</em>.
The sheep are of the fat-tailed variety, and the tails are the
great delicacy."</p>

<p>This last sentence reminds us that there are two breeds of
Sheep in Palestine. One much resembles the ordinary English
Sheep, while the other is a very different animal. It is much
taller on its legs, larger-boned, and long-nosed. Only the
rams have horns, and they are not twisted spirally like those
of our own Sheep, but come backwards, and then curl round so
that the point comes under the ear. The great peculiarity of
this Sheep is the tail, which is simply prodigious in point of size,
and is an enormous mass of fat. Indeed, the long-legged and
otherwise lean animal seems to concentrate all its fat in the tail,
which, as has been well observed, appears to abstract both flesh
and fat from the rest of the body. So great is this strange
development, that the tail alone will sometimes weigh one-fifth
as much as the entire animal. A similar breed of Sheep is found
in Southern Africa and other parts of the world. In some places,
the tail grows to such an enormous size that, in order to keep
so valuable a part of the animal from injury, it is fastened to
a small board, supported by a couple of wheels, so that the Sheep
literally wheels its own tail in a cart.</p>

<p>Frequent reference to the fat of the tail is made in the
Authorized Version of the Scriptures, though in terms which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would not be understood did we not know that the Sheep
which is mentioned in those passages is the long-tailed
Sheep of Syria. See, for example, the history narrated in
Exod. xxix. 22, where special details are given as to the
ceremony by which Aaron and his sons were consecrated
to the priesthood. "Thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the
rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above
the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="flocks" id="flocks"></a>
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="flocks" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">FLOCKS OF SHEEP BEING TAKEN INTO JERUSALEM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Though this particular breed is not very distinctly mentioned
in the Bible, the Talmudical writers have many allusions
to it. In the Mischna these broad-tailed Sheep are not allowed
to leave their folds on the Sabbath-day, because by wheeling
their little tail-waggons behind them they would break the
Sabbath. The writers describe the tail very graphically, comparing
its shape to that of a saddle, and saying that it is fat,
without bones, heavy and long, and looks as if the whole body
were continued beyond the hind-legs, and thence hung down in
place of a tail.</p>

<p>The Rabbinical writers treat rather fully of the Sheep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
give some very amusing advice respecting their management.
If the ewes cannot be fattened in the ordinary manner, that end
may be achieved by tying up the udder so that the milk cannot
flow, and the elements which would have furnished milk are
forced to produce fat. If the weather should be chilly at the
shearing time, and there is danger of taking cold after the wool
is removed, the shepherd should dip a sponge in oil and tie it
on the forehead of the newly-shorn animal. Or, if he should
not have a sponge by him, a woollen rag will do as well. The
same potent remedy is also efficacious if the Sheep should be ill
in lambing time.</p>

<p>That the Sheep is liable to the attack of the gadfly, which
deposits its eggs in the nostrils of the unfortunate animal,
was as well known in the ancient as in modern times. It is
scarcely necessary to mention that the insect in question is
the <em>Æstrus ovis</em>. Instinctively aware of the presence of this
insidious and dreaded enemy, which, though so apparently
insignificant, is as formidable a foe as any of the beasts of
prey, the Sheep display the greatest terror at the sharp,
menacing sound produced by the gadfly's wings as the insect
sweeps through the air towards its destination. They congregate
together, placing their heads almost in contact with each
other, snort and paw the ground in their terror, and use all means
in their power to prevent the fly from accomplishing its purpose.</p>

<p>When a gadfly succeeds in attaining its aim, it rapidly
deposits an egg or two in the nostril, and then leaves them.
The tiny eggs are soon hatched by the natural heat of the
animal, and the young larvæ crawl up the nostril towards the
frontal sinus. There they remain until they are full-grown, when
they crawl through the nostrils, fall on the ground, burrow
therein, and in the earth undergo their changes into the pupal
and perfect stages.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that an intelligent shepherd would
devote himself to the task of killing every gadfly which he
could find, and, as these insects are fond of basking on sunny
rocks or tree-trunks, this is no very difficult matter.</p>

<p>The Rabbinical writers, however, being totally ignorant of
practical entomology, do not seem to have recognised the insect
until it had reached its full larval growth. They say that the
rams manage to shake the grubs out of their nostrils by butting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
at one another in mimic warfare, and that the ewes, which are
hornless, and are therefore incapable of relieving themselves
by such means, ought to be supplied with plants which will
make them sneeze, so that they may shake out the grubs by
the convulsive jerkings of the head caused by inhaling the
irritating substance.</p>

<p>The same writers also recommend that the rams should be
furnished with strong leathern collars.</p>

<p>When the flock is on the march, the rams always go in the
van, and, being instinctively afraid of their ancient enemy the
wolf, they continually raise their heads and look about them.
This line of conduct irritates the wolves, who attack the foremost
rams and seize them by the throat. If, therefore, a piece
of stout leather be fastened round the ram's neck, the wolf is
baffled, and runs off in sullen despair.</p>

<p>Generally, the oldest ram is distinguished by a bell, and, when
the flock moves over the hilly slopes, the Sheep walk in file after
the leader, making narrow paths, which are very distinct from a
distance, but are scarcely perceptible when the foot of the
traveller is actually upon them. From this habit has arisen an
ancient proverb, "As the sheep after the sheep, so the daughter
after the mother," a saying which is another form of our own
familiar proverb, "What is bred in the bone will not come out
of the flesh."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to the Sheep considered with reference to its
uses. First and foremost the Sheep was, and still is, one of the
chief means of subsistence, being to the pastoral inhabitants of
Palestine what the oxen are to the pastoral inhabitants of
Southern Africa.</p>

<p>To ordinary persons the flesh of the Sheep was a seldom-tasted
luxury; great men might eat it habitually, "faring
sumptuously every day," and we find that, among the glories of
Solomon's reign, the sacred chronicler has thought it worth while
to mention that part of the daily provision for his household
included one hundred Sheep. No particular pains seem to have
been taken about the cooking of the animal, which seems generally
to have been boiled. As, however, in such a climate the
flesh could not be kept for the purpose of making it tender, as is
the case in this part of the world, it was cooked as soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
animal was killed, the fibres not having time to settle into the
rigidity of death.</p>

<p>Generally, when ordinary people had the opportunity of
tasting the flesh of the Sheep, it was on the occasion of some
rejoicing,&mdash;such, for example, as a marriage feast, or the advent of
a guest, for whom a lamb or a kid was slain and cooked on the
spot, a young male lamb being almost invariably chosen as less
injurious than the ewe to the future prospects of the flock.
Roasting over a fire was sometimes adopted, as was baking in an
oven sunk in the ground, a remarkable instance of which we
shall see when we come to the Jewish sacrifices. Boiling,
however, was the principal mode; so much so, indeed, that the
Hebrew word which signifies boiling is used to signify any kind
of cooking, even when the meat was roasted.</p>

<p>The process of cooking and eating the Sheep was as follows.</p>

<p>The animal having been killed according to the legal form, the
skin was stripped off, and the body separated joint from joint,
the right shoulder being first removed. This, it will be remembered,
was the priest's portion; see Lev. vii. 32: "The right
shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the
sacrifices of your peace offerings." The whole of the flesh was
then separated from the bones, and chopped small, and even the
bones themselves broken up, so that the marrow might not
be lost.</p>

<p>A reference to this custom is found in Micah iii. 2, 3, "Who
pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their
bones; who also eat the flesh of my people ... and they break
their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh
within the caldron." The reader will now understand more fully
the force of the prophecy, "He keepeth all His bones: not one of
them is broken" (Psa. xxxiv. 20).</p>

<p>The mixed mass of bones and flesh was then put into the
caldron, which was generally filled with water, but sometimes
with milk, as is the custom with the Bedouins of the present
day, whose manners are in many respects identical with those
of the early Jews. It has been thought by some commentators
that the injunction not to "seethe a kid in his mothers milk"
(Deut. xiv. 21) referred to this custom. I believe, however, that
the expression "in his mother's milk" does not signify that the
flesh of the kid might not be boiled in its mother's milk, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that a kid might not be taken which was still in its mother's
milk, <em>i.e.</em> unweaned.</p>

<p>Salt and spices were generally added to it; see Ezek. xxiv. 10:
"Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
well." The surface was carefully skimmed, and, when the meat
was thoroughly cooked, it and the broth were served up separately.
The latter was used as a sort of sauce, into which unleavened
bread was dipped. So in Judges vi. 19 we read that
when Gideon was visited by the angel, according to the hospitable
custom of the land, he "made ready a kid, and unleavened
cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket,
and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him
under the oak, and presented it to him."</p>

<p>Valuable, however, as was the Sheep for this purpose, there
has always existed a great reluctance to kill the animal, the very
sight of the flocks being an intense gratification to a pastoral
Oriental. The principal part of the food supplied by the Sheep
was, and is still, the milk; which afforded abundant food without
thinning the number of the flock. As all know who have
tasted it, the milk of the Sheep is peculiarly rich, and in the
East is valued much more highly than that of cattle. The
milk was seldom drunk in a fresh state, as is usually the case
with ourselves, but was suffered to become sour, curdled, and
semi-solid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to a portion of the Sheep scarcely less important
than the flesh and the milk, <em>i.e.</em> the fleece, or wool.</p>

<p>In the ancient times nearly the whole of the clothing was
made of wool, especially the most valuable part of it, namely
the large mantle, or "haick," in which the whole person could
be folded, and which was the usual covering during sleep. The
wool, therefore, would be an article of great national value; and
so we find that when the king of Moab paid his tribute in kind
to the king of Israel, it was carefully specified that the Sheep
should not be shorn. "And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master,
and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand
lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool."</p>

<p>The wool of the Sheep of Palestine differed extremely in value;
some kinds being coarse and rough, while others were fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The wool was dressed in those times much as it is at present,
being carded and then spun with the spindle, the distaff
being apparently unused, and the wool simply drawn out by the
hand. The shape of the spindle was much like that of the well-known
flat spinning-tops that come from Japan&mdash;namely, a
disc through which passes an axle. A smart twirl given by the
fingers to the axle makes the disc revolve very rapidly, and its
weight causes the rotation to continue for a considerable time.
Spinning the wool was exclusively the task of the women, a
custom which prevailed in this country up to a very recent
time, and which still traditionally survives in the term "spinster,"
and in the metaphorical use of the word "distaff" as synonymous
with a woman's proper work.</p>

<p>When spun into threads, the wool was woven in the simple
loom which has existed up to our own day, and which is
identical in its general principles throughout a very large
portion of the world. It consisted of a framework of wood, at
one end of which was placed the "beam" to which the warp
was attached; and at the other end was the "pin" on which the
cloth was rolled as it was finished.</p>

<p>The reader may remember that when Delilah was cajoling
Samson to tell her the secret of his strength, he said, "If thou
weavest the seven locks of my head with the web." So, as he
slept, she interwove his long hair with the fabric which was on
her loom, and, to make sure, "fastened it with the pin," <em>i.e.</em> wove
it completely into the cloth which was rolled round the pin.
So firmly had she done so, that when he awoke he could not
disentangle his hair, but left the house with the whole of the
loom, the beam and the pin, and the web hanging to his head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wool was often dyed of various colours; blue, purple, and
scarlet being those which were generally employed. The rams'
skins which formed part of the covering of the Tabernacle were
ordered to be dyed scarlet, partly on account of the significance
of the colour, and partly because none but the best and purest
fleeces would be chosen for so rare and costly a dye. How the
colour was produced we shall learn towards the end of the
volume.</p>

<p>Sheep-shearing was always a time of great rejoicing and revelry,
which seem often to have been carried beyond the bounds of sobriety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Thus when Nabal had gathered together his three thousand
Sheep in Carmel, and held a shearing festival, David sent to
ask for some provisions for his band, and was refused in accordance
with the disposition of the man, who had inflamed his naturally
churlish nature with wine. "He held a feast in his house, like
the feast of a king: and Nabal's heart was merry within him,
for he was very drunken" (1 Sam. xxv. 36).</p>

<p>The same was probably the case when Laban was shearing his
Sheep (Gen. xxxi. 19). Otherwise it would scarcely have been
possible for Jacob to have gone away unknown to Laban, taking
with him his wives and children, his servants, his camels, and
his flocks, the rapid increase of which had excited the jealousy
of his uncle, and which were so numerous that, in fear of his
brother Esau, he divided them into two bands, and yet was able
to select from them a present to his brother, consisting in all of
nearly six hundred sheep, camels, oxen, goats, and asses.</p>

<p>Sometimes the shepherds and others who lived in pastoral
districts made themselves coats of the skins of the Sheep, with
the wool still adhering to it. The custom extends to the present
day, and even in many parts of Europe the sheep-skin dress of
the shepherds is a familiar sight to the traveller. The skin was
sometimes tanned and used as leather, but was considered as
inferior to that of the goat. Mr. Tristram conjectures that the
leathern "girdle" worn by St. John the Baptist was probably the
untanned sheep-skin coat which has been just mentioned. So
it is said of the early Christians, that "they wandered about in
sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented,"
the sheep-skins in question being evidently the rude shepherd's
coats.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The horn of the ram had a national value, as from it were
made the sacred trumpets which played so important a part in
the history of the Jewish nation. There is no doubt that the
primitive trumpets were originally formed either from the horn
of an animal, such as the ox, the large-horned antelopes, the
sheep, and the goat, and that in process of time they were made
of metal, generally copper or silver.</p>

<p>References are frequently made in the Bible to these trumpets,
for which there were different names, probably on account of
their different forms. These names are, however, very loosely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
rendered in our version, the same word being sometimes translated
the "cornet," and sometimes the "trumpet."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="sounding" id="sounding"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SOUNDING THE TRUMPETS IN THE YEAR OF JUBILEE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The jubilee year was always ushered in by the blasts of the
sacred trumpets. "Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the
day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
all your land" (Lev. xxv. 9). Then there was the festival
known as the Feast of Trumpets. "In the seventh month, on
the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation;
ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets
unto you" (Numb. xxix. 1).</p>

<p>One of these trumpets is now before me, and is shown in the
accompanying illustration.</p>

<p>In length it measures eighteen inches, <em>i.e.</em> a cubit, and it is
formed entirely in one piece. As far as I can judge, it is made
from the left horn of the broad-tailed Sheep, which, as has already
been remarked, is not spiral, but flattish, curved backwards, and
forming nearly a circle, the point passing under the ear. This
structure, added to the large size of the horn, adapts it well for
its purpose. In order to bring it to the proper shape, the horn
is softened by heat, and is then modelled into the very form
which was used by the Jewish priests who blew the trumpet
before the ark.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="horn" id="horn"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">RAM'S HORN TRUMPET.</p></div>

<p>At the present day one such trumpet, at least, is found in
every Jewish community, and is kept by the man who has the
privilege of blowing it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to the important subject, the use of the Sheep
in sacrifice.</p>

<p>No animal was used so frequently for this purpose as the
Sheep, and in many passages of the Mosaic law are specified
the precise age as well as the sex of the Sheep which was to be
sacrificed in certain circumstances. Sometimes the Sheep was
sacrificed as an offering of thanksgiving, sometimes as an
expiation for sin, and sometimes as a redemption for some more
valuable animal. The young male lamb was the usual sacrifice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and almost the only sacrifice for which a Sheep might not be
offered was that of the two goats on the great Day of Atonement.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="burnt" id="burnt"></a>
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="400" height="373" alt="burnt" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A LAMB UPON THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To mention all the passages in which the Sheep is ordered for
sacrifice would occupy too much of our space, and we will therefore
restrict ourselves to the one central rite of the Jewish nation,
the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb, the precursor of the Lamb of
God, who taketh away the sins of the world.</p>

<p>Without examining in full the various ceremonies of the
Paschal sacrifice, we will glance over the salient points which
distinguish it from any other sacrifice.</p>

<p>The lamb must be a male, which is selected and examined
with the minutest care, that it may be free from all blemish,
and must be of the first year. It must be killed on the fourteenth
of the month Abib as the sun is setting, and the blood
must be sprinkled with hyssop. In the first or Egyptian Passover
the blood was sprinkled on the lintels and doorposts of
the houses, but afterwards on the altar. It must be roasted
with fire, and not boiled, after the usual custom in the East;
not a bone must be broken. It must be eaten by the household
in haste, as if they were just starting on a journey, and if any
of it should be left, it must be consumed in the fire, and not
eaten on the following day.</p>

<p>Such are the chief points in connexion with the Paschal rite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
at once a sacrifice and a feast. The original directions not being
sufficiently minute to meet all the practical difficulties which
might hinder the correct performance of the rite, a vast number
of directions are given by the Rabbinical writers. In order, for
example, to guard against the destruction of any part of the
animal by careless cooking over a fire, or the possible fracture of
a bone by a sudden jet of flame, the Paschal lamb was rather
baked than roasted, being placed in an earthen oven from
which the ashes had been removed. In order to prevent it
from being burned or blackened against the sides of the oven,
(in which case it would be cooked with earthenware and not
with fire), it was transfixed with a wooden stake, made from the
pomegranate-tree, and a transverse spit was thrust through the
shoulders. These spits were made of wood, because a metal spit
would become heated in the oven, and would cause all the flesh
which it touched to be roasted with metal, and not with fire;
and the wood of the pomegranate was chosen, because that
wood was supposed not to emit any sap when heated. If a
drop of water had fallen on the flesh, the law would have been
broken, as that part of the flesh would be considered as boiled,
and not roasted.</p>

<p>As to the eating of unleavened bread and bitter herbs with
the lamb, the custom does not bear on the present subject.
In shape the oven seems to have resembled a straw beehive,
having an opening at the side by which the fuel could be
removed and the lamb inserted.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the Passover has been described by several
persons, such as the late Consul Rogers and the Dean of Westminster,
the latter of whom has given, a most striking and vivid
account of the rite in his "Lectures on the Jewish Church."</p>

<p>The place which is now employed in the celebration of this
rite is a level spot about two hundred yards from the summit of
the mountain, a place which is apparently selected on account
of its comparative quiet and seclusion. Dean Stanley thinks
that in former times, when the Samaritans were the masters of
the country, they celebrated the sacrifice on the sacred plateau
on the very summit of the mountain, so that the rite could be
seen for a vast distance on every side. Now, however, the less
conspicuous place is preferred. By the kindness of the Palestine
Exploration Society, I am enabled to present the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
with a view of this sacred spot, taken from a photograph made
an hour or two before the time of sacrifice. The rough, rugged
character of the mountain is shown by this illustration, though
not so well as in several other photographs of Gerizim, in which
the entire surface seems to be loosely covered with stones like
those of which the low wall is built. Near the centre of the
illustration may be seen a pile of sticks and the tops of two
caldrons, on each of which a stone is laid to keep the cover from
being blown off by the wind. These sticks nearly fill a trench
in which the caldrons are sunk, and their use will be presently
seen on reading Dean Stanley's narrative. In the far distance
are the plains of Samaria, and the long-drawn shadows of the
priest and his nephew, and probable successor, show that the
time of sacrifice is rapidly approaching.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>On the previous day the whole of the community had pitched
their tents on the mountain, and as the time of sunset approached
the women retired to the tents, and all the males, except those
who were unclean according to the provisions of the Mosaic law,
assembled near a long deep trench that had been dug in the
ground. The men are clothed in long white garments, and the
six young men who are selected as the actual sacrifices are
dressed in white drawers and shirts. These youths are trained
to the duty, but whether they hold any sacred office could not
be ascertained.</p>

<p>Then, according to the narrative of Dean Stanley, "the priest,
ascending a large rough stone in front of the congregation, recited
in a loud chant or scream, in which the others joined,
prayers or praises chiefly turning on the glories of Abraham
and Isaac. Their attitude was that of all Orientals in prayer;
standing, occasionally diversified by the stretching out of the
hands, and more rarely by kneeling or crouching, with their
knees wrapped in their clothes and bent to the ground, towards
the Holy Place on the summit of Gerizim. The priest recited
his prayers by heart; the others had mostly books in Hebrew
and Arabic.</p>

<p>"Presently, suddenly there appeared amongst the worshippers
six sheep, driven up by the side of the youths before mentioned.
The unconscious innocence with which they wandered to and
fro amongst the bystanders, and the simplicity in aspect and
manner of the young men who tended them, more recalled a
pastoral scene in Arcadia, or one of those inimitable patriarchal
<em>tableaux</em> represented in the Ammergau Mystery, than a religious
ceremonial.</p>

<p>"The sun, meanwhile, which had hitherto burnished up the
Mediterranean in the distance, now sank very nearly to the
farthest western ridge overhanging the plain of Sharon. The
recitation became more vehement. The priest turned about,
facing his brethren, and the whole history of the Exodus from
the beginning of the plagues of Egypt was rapidly, almost
furiously, chanted. The sheep, still innocently playful, were
driven more closely together.</p>

<p>"The setting sun now touched the ridge. The youths burst
into a wild murmur of their own, drew forth their long bright
knives, and brandished them aloft. In a moment the sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
were thrown on their backs, and the flashing knives rapidly
drawn across their throats. Then a few convulsive but silent
struggles&mdash;'as a sheep ... dumb ... that openeth not his mouth,'&mdash;and
the six forms lay lifeless on the ground, the blood streaming
from them; the one only Jewish sacrifice lingering in the world.
In the blood the young men dipped their fingers, and a small
spot was marked on the foreheads and noses of the children. A
few years ago the red stain was placed on all. But this had
now dwindled away into the present practice, preserved, we were
told, as a relic or emblem of the whole. Then, as if in congratulation
at the completion of the ceremony, they all kissed
each other, in the Oriental fashion, on each side of the head.</p>

<p>"The next process was that of the fleecing and roasting of the
slaughtered animals, for which the ancient temple furnished
such ample provisions. Two holes on the mountain side had
been dug; one at some distance, of considerable depth, the other,
close to the scene of the sacrifice, comparatively shallow. In
this latter cavity, after a short prayer, a fire was kindled, out of
the mass of dry heath, juniper, and briers, such as furnished the
materials for the conflagration in Jotham's parable, delivered not
far from this spot.</p>

<p>"Over the fire were placed two caldrons full of water. Whilst
the water boiled, the congregation again stood around, and (as if
for economy of time) continued the recitation of the Book of
Exodus, and bitter herbs were handed round wrapped in a strip
of unleavened bread&mdash;'with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
shall they eat it.' Then was chanted another short prayer; after
which the six youths again appeared, poured the boiling water
over the sheep, and plucked off their fleeces. The right forelegs
of the sheep, with the entrails, were thrown aside and burnt.
The liver was carefully put back. Long poles were brought, on
which the animals were spitted; near the bottom of each pole
was a transverse peg or stick, to prevent the body from slipping
off."</p>

<p>This cross-piece does not, however, penetrate the body, which
in most cases scarcely touches it, so that there is little or no
resemblance to a crucifixion. The writer lays especial stress on
this point, because the early Christians saw in the transverse spit
an emblem of the cross. In the Jewish Passover this emblem
would have been more appropriate, as in that ceremony the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
cross-piece was passed through the shoulders, and the forefeet
tied to it.</p>

<p>The Sheep being now prepared, they were carried to the oven,
which on this occasion was a deep, circular pit, in which a fire
had been previously kindled. Into this the victims were carefully
lowered, the stakes on which they were impaled guarding
their bodies from touching the sides of the oven, and the cross-piece
at the end preventing them from slipping off the stake to
the bottom of the pit among the ashes. A hurdle was then laid
on the mouth of the pit, and wet earth was heaped upon it so as
to close it completely. The greater part of the community then
retired to rest. In about five hours, the Paschal moon being
high in the heavens, announcement was made that the feast was
about to begin. Then, to resume Dean Stanley's narrative,</p>

<p>"Suddenly the covering of the hole was torn off, and up rose
into the still moonlit sky a vast column of smoke and steam;
recalling, with a shock of surprise, that, even by an accidental
coincidence, Reginald Heber should have so well caught this
striking feature of so remote and unknown a ritual:</p>

<p>
'Smokes on Gerizim's mount Samaria's sacrifice.'<br />
</p>

<p>"Out of the pit were dragged successively the six sheep, on
their long spits, black from the oven. The outlines of their
heads, their ears, their legs, were still visible&mdash;'his head, with
his legs, and with the inward parts thereof.' They were hoisted
aloft, and then thrown on large square brown mats, previously
prepared for their reception, on which we were carefully prevented
from treading, as also from touching even the extremities
of the spit.</p>

<p>"The bodies thus wrapped in the mats were hurried down to
the trench where the sacrifice had taken place, and laid out upon
them in a line between two files of the Samaritans. Those who
had before been dressed in white robes still retained them, with
the addition now of shoes on their feet and staves in their hands,
and ropes round their waists&mdash;'thus shall ye eat it; with your
loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staff in your hand.'
The recitation of prayers or of the Pentateuch recommenced, and
continued till it suddenly terminated in their all sitting down on
their haunches, after the Arab fashion at meals, and beginning
to eat. This, too, is a deviation from the practice of only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
years since, when they retained the Mosaic ritual of standing
whilst they ate. The actual feast was conducted in rapid silence,
as of men in hunger, as no doubt most of them were, and so as
soon to consume every portion of the blackened masses, which
they tore away piecemeal with their fingers&mdash;'ye shall eat in
haste.' There was a general merriment, as of a hearty and
welcome meal.</p>

<p>"In ten minutes all was gone but a few remnants. To the
priest and to the women, who, all but two (probably his two
wives), remained in the tents, separate morsels were carried
round. The remnants were gathered into the mats, and put on a
wooden grate, or hurdle, over the hole where the water had been
originally boiled; the fire was again lit, and a huge bonfire was
kindled. By its blaze, and by candles lighted for the purpose,
the ground was searched in every direction, as for the consecrated
particles of sacramental elements; and these fragments of
flesh and bone were thrown upon the burning mass&mdash;'ye shall
let nothing remain until the morning; and that which remaineth
until the morning ye shall burn with fire;' 'there shall not
anything of the flesh which thou sacrificest the first day at even
remain all night until the morning;' 'thou shalt not carry forth
aught of the flesh abroad out of the house.' The flames blazed
up once more, and then gradually sank away.</p>

<h2>THE CHAMOIS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Zemer or Chamois only once mentioned in the Bible&mdash;Signification of the word
Zemer&mdash;Probability that the Zemer is the Aoudad&mdash;Its strength and activity&mdash;The
Mouflon probably classed with the Aoudad under the name of Zemer.</p></blockquote>


<p>Among the animals which may be used for food is mentioned one
which in our version is rendered Chamois. See Deut. xiv. 5, a
passage which has several times been quoted.</p>

<p>It is evident to any one acquainted with zoology that, whatever
may be the Hebrew word, "Chamois" cannot be the correct rendering,
inasmuch as this animal does not inhabit Palestine, nor are
there any proofs that it ever did so. The Chamois frequents the
lofty inaccessible crags of the highest mountains, finding its food
in the scanty herbage which grows in such regions, appearing on
the brink of awful precipices, and leaping from ledge to ledge
with ease and safety. We must, therefore, look for some other
animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chamois is one of the most wary of Antelopes, and possesses
the power of scenting mankind at what would seem to be an impossible
distance.</p>

<p>Its ears are as acute as its nostrils, so that there are few animals
which are so difficult to approach.</p>

<p>Only those who have been trained to climb the giddy heights of
the Alpine Mountains, to traverse the most fearful precipices with
a quiet pulse and steady head, to exist for days amid the terrible
solitudes of ice, rock, and snow,&mdash;only these, can hope to come
within sight of the Chamois, when the animal is at large upon
its native cliffs.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word, which has been rendered Chamois, is
Zamar, or Zemer, <em>i. e.</em> the leaper, and therefore an animal which
is conspicuous for its agility. Zoologists have now agreed in
the opinion that the Zamer of Deuteronomy is the handsome
wild sheep which we know under the name of Aoudad (<em>Ammotragus
Tragelaphus</em>). This splendid sheep is known by various
names. It is the Jaela of some authors, and the Bearded Sheep of
others. It is also called the Fichtall, or Lerwea; and the French
zoologists describe it under the name of <em>Mouflon à manchettes</em>,
in allusion to the fringe of long hair that ornaments the fore
limbs.</p>

<p>The Aoudad is a large and powerful animal, exceedingly
active, and has the habits of the goat rather than of the sheep,
on which account it is reckoned among the goats by the Arabs
of the present day, and doubtless was similarly classed by the
ancient inhabitants of Palestine. The height of the adult
Aoudad is about three feet, and its general colour is pale dun,
relieved by the dark masses of long hair that fall from the neck
and the tufts of similar hair which decorate the knees of the
male. The female is also bearded and tufted, but the hair,
which in the male looks like the mane of the lion, in the female
is but slightly developed.</p>

<p>It is so powerful and active an animal, that an adult male
which lived for some time in the Zoological Gardens was much
dreaded by the keepers, not even the man who fed it liking to
enter the enclosure if he could help himself. The animal was
given to making unexpected charges, and would do so with
astonishing quickness, springing round and leaping at the object
of his hate with tremendous force, and with such rapidity that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
even the experienced keeper, who knew all the ways of the
animals under his charge, had often some difficulty in slipping
behind the door, against which the horns of the Aoudad would
clatter as if they would break the door to pieces. So fond was
he of attacking something that he would often butt repeatedly
at the wooden side of the shed, hurling himself against it with
eager fury.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CHASING THE AOUDAD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The horns of the Aoudad are about two feet in length, and are
of considerable diameter. They curve boldly and gracefully
backwards, their points diverging considerably from each other,
so that when the animal throws its head up, the points of the
horns come on either side of the back. This divergence of the
horns has another object. They cover a considerable space, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that when the animal makes its charge the object of its anger
has much more difficulty in escaping the blow than if the horns
were closer together.</p>

<p>Whether these horns were used as musical instruments is
doubtful, simply because we are not absolutely sure that the
Zamar and the Aoudad are identical, however great may be the
probability. But inasmuch as the horn-trumpets were evidently
of various sizes, it is certain that the Jewish musicians would
never have neglected to take advantage of such magnificent
materials as they would obtain from the horns of this animal.
Perhaps the Chaldaic "keren" may have been the horn of the
Aoudad, or of the animal which will next be mentioned.</p>

<p>The Aoudad is wonderfully active, and even the young ones
bound to an astonishing height. I have seen the marks of their
hoofs eight feet from the ground.</p>

<p>In its wild state the Aoudad lives in little flocks or herds,
and prefers the high and rocky ground, over which it leaps with
a sure-footed agility equal to that of the Chamois itself. These
flocks are chased by hunters, who try to get it upon the lowest
and least broken ground, where it is at a disadvantage, and
then run it down with their horses, as seen in the illustration
on page 214.</p>

<p>The Aoudad was formerly plentiful in Egypt, and even now
is found along the Atlas mountain-range. It is seen on the
Egyptian monuments, and, owing to its evident profusion, we
have every reason to conjecture that it was one of those animals
which were specially indicated as chewing the cud and cleaving
the hoof.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps the <span class="smcap">Mouflon</span> (<em>Caprovis Musimon</em>) may be the animal
which is meant by the Hebrew word Zamar, and it is not
unlikely that both animals may have been included in one
name.</p>

<p>This animal, which is nearly allied to the Aoudad, is also
very goatlike in general aspect. It is indeed to this resemblance
that the name Caprovis, or goat-sheep, has been given to it. The
name Ammotragus, which, as mentioned above, belongs to the
Aoudad, has a similar signification.</p>

<p>The horns of the Mouflon belong only to the male animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and are of enormous size, so that if trumpets of deep tone and
great power were needed, they could be obtained from the horns
of this animal. Those of the Aoudad are very large, and would
be well adapted for the same purpose, but they would not furnish
such instruments as the horns of the Mouflon, which are so
large that they seem almost unwieldy for an animal of twice
the Mouflon's size, and give visible proofs of the strength and
agility of an animal which can carry them so lightly and leap
about under their weight so easily as does the Mouflon.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 375px;"><a name="mouflon" id="mouflon"></a>
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="375" height="389" alt="mouflon" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE MOUFLON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the present time the Mouflon is only to be found in
Crete, Sardinia, and Corsica, but formerly it was known to
inhabit many other parts of the earth, and was almost certainly
one of the many animals which then haunted the Lebanon, but
which have in later days been extirpated.</p>

<h2>THE GOAT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Value of the Goat&mdash;Its use in furnishing food&mdash;The male kid the usual animal of
slaughter&mdash;Excellence of the flesh and deception of Isaac&mdash;Milk of the Goat&mdash;An

habits of the Goat&mdash;Separation of the Goats from the sheep&mdash;Performing
Goats&mdash;Different breeds of Goats in Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>Whether considered in reference to food, to clothing, or to
sacrifice, the <span class="smcap">Goat</span> was scarcely a less important animal than the
sheep. It was especially valuable in such a country as Palestine,
in which the soil and the climate vary so much according
to the locality. Upon the large fertile plains the sheep are bred
in vast flocks, the rich and succulent grass being exactly to their
taste; while in the hilly and craggy districts the Goats abound,
and delight in browsing upon the scanty herbage that grows
upon the mountain-side.</p>

<p>For food the Goat was even more extensively used than the
sheep. The adult male was, of course, not eaten, being very
tough, and having an odour which would repel any but an
actually starving man. Neither were the females generally
eaten, as they were needed for the future increase of the flocks.
The young male kid formed the principal material of a feast, and
as soon as a stranger claimed the hospitality of a man in good
circumstances, the first thing that was done was to take a young
male kid and dress it for him.</p>

<p>For example, when the angel visited Gideon in the guise of a
stranger, Gideon "went in and made ready a kid, and unleavened
cakes of an ephah of flour," and brought them to his
guest (Judges vi. 19). And when Isaac was on his death-bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and asked Esau to take his bow and arrows and hunt for
"venison," which was probably the flesh of one of the antelopes
which have already been mentioned, a ready substitute was
found in the two kids, from whose flesh Rebekah made the dish
for which he longed. The imposition might easily pass without
detection, because the flesh of the kid is peculiarly tender, and
can scarcely be distinguished from lamb, even when simply
roasted. Isaac, therefore, with his senses dulled by his great
age, was the less likely to discover the imposture, when the flesh
of the kids was stewed into "savoury meat such as he loved."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="deceives" id="deceives"></a>
<img src="images/i_217.jpg" width="400" height="338" alt="deceives" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JACOB DECEIVES HIS FATHER AND TAKES ESAU'S BLESSING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A curious illustration of the prevalence of kid's flesh as food
is given in the parable of the prodigal son, for whom his father
had killed the fatted calf. "And he answering said to his
father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed
I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me
a kid, that I might make merry with my friends" (Luke xv. 29).
The force of the reproval cannot be properly understood unless we
are acquainted with the customs of the East. The kid was the
least valuable animal that could have been given, less valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
than a lamb, and infinitely inferior to the fatted calf, which was
kept in wealthy households for some feast of more than ordinary
magnificence.</p>

<p>The kid was cooked exactly in the same manner as the sheep,
namely, by cutting to pieces and stewing in a caldron, the meat
and broth being served separately. See, for example, the case of
Gideon, to whom a reference has already been made. When he
brought the banquet to his guest, "the flesh he put in a basket,
and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under
the oak, and presented it. And the angel of God said unto him,
Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this
rock, and pour out the broth."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="gideon" id="gideon"></a>
<img src="images/i_218.jpg" width="400" height="311" alt="gideon" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ANGEL APPEARS TO GIDEON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Gideon did so, and the angel reached forth the staff that was in
his hand, and touched the flesh, and there rose up fire out of the
rock and burnt up the offering.</p>

<p>The same custom exists at the present day. When an Arab chief
receives a guest, a kid is immediately killed and given to the women to
be cooked, and the guest is pressed to stay until it is ready, in the very
words used by Gideon three thousand years ago. "Depart not hence,
I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and
set it before thee." The refusal of proffered hospitality would be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and still is considered to be, either a studied insult, or a proof
of bad manners, and no one with any claims to breeding would
commit such an action without urgent cause and much apology.</p>

<p>Like the sheep, the Goat is extremely valuable as a milk-producer,
and at the present day the milk of the Goat is used
as largely as that of the sheep. "At Rasheiya, under Mount
Hermon," writes Mr. Tristram, "we saw some hundreds of
goats gathering for the night in the wide open market-place
beneath the castle. It was no easy matter to thread our way
among them, as they had no idea of moving for such belated intruders
on their rest. All the she-goats of the neighbouring hills
are driven in every evening, and remain for their morning's
milking, after which they set forth on their day's excursion.</p>

<p>"Each house possesses several, and all know their owners.
The evening milking is a picturesque scene. Every street and
open space is filled with the goats; and women, boys, and girls
are everywhere milking with their small pewter pots, while the
goats are anxiously awaiting their turn, or lying down to chew
the cud as soon as it is over. As no kids or he-goats are
admitted, the scene is very orderly, and there is none of the
deafening bleating which usually characterises large flocks.</p>

<p>"These mountain goats are a solemn set, and by the gravity of
their demeanour excite a suspicion that they have had no youth,
and never were kids. They need no herdsman to bring them
home in the evening, for, fully sensible of the danger of remaining
unprotected, they hurry homewards of their own accord
as soon as the sun begins to decline."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Like the wool of the sheep, the hair of the Goat is used for
the manufacture of clothing; and, as is the case with wool, its
quality differs according to the particular breed of the animal,
which assumes almost as many varieties as the sheep or the dog.
The hair of some varieties is thick and rough, and can only be
made into coarse cloths, while others, of which the mohair Goat
and Cashmere Goat are familiar examples, furnish a staple of
surpassing delicacy and fineness. It is most likely that the
covering and curtains of the Tabernacle mentioned in Exod.
xxvi. 7 were of the latter kind, as otherwise they would have
been out of character with the fine linen, and blue and scarlet,
their golden clasps, and the profuse magnificence which distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
every part of the sacred building. Moreover, the hair
of the Goat is classed among the costly offerings which were
made when the Tabernacle was built. "And they came forth,
men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought
bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of
gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold
unto the Lord. And every man, with whom was found blue,
and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red
skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them" to be used in
the structure of that wonderful building, in which nothing
might be used except the finest and costliest that could be
procured.</p>

<p>One of the principal uses to which the goat-skin was applied
was the manufacture of leather, for which purpose it is still
used, and is considered far better than that of the sheep.
Perhaps the most common form in which this leather is used
is the well-known water-vessel, or "bottle" of the Bible.</p>

<p>These so-called bottles are made from the entire skin of the
animal, which is prepared in slightly different methods according
to the locality in which the manufacture is carried on. In
Palestine they are soaked for some little time in the tanning
mixture, and are then filled with water, after the seams have
been pitched. In this state they are kept for some time, and
are kept exposed to the sun, covered entirely with the tanning
fluid, and filled up with water to supply the loss caused by
evaporation and leakage.</p>

<p>The hair is allowed to remain on the skins, because it acts as
a preservative against the rough usage to which they are subject
at the hard hands of the water-carriers. By degrees the hairy
covering wears off, first in patches, and then over the entire
surface, so that a new bottle can be recognised at a glance, and
any one who wished to sell an old bottle at the price of a new
one would be at once detected.</p>

<p>Vessels made in this rude manner are absolutely necessary in
the countries wherein they are used. Wooden or metal vessels
would be too heavy, and, besides, the slight though constant
evaporation that always takes place through the pores of the
leather keeps down the temperature of the water, even under a
burning sun, the slight loss which is caused by the porousness of
the skin being more than counterbalanced by the coolness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
water. It is true that the goat-skin communicates to the liquid
a flavour far from pleasant, but in those countries the quality of
the water is of little consequence, provided that it is plentiful in
quantity, and tolerably cool.</p>

<p>In all parts of the world where the skin is used for this
purpose the mode of manufacture is practically identical. An
account of the art of preparing the goat-skin as practised in
Abyssinia is given by Mr. C. Johnston, in his "Travels in
Southern Abyssinia:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"To be of any value it must be taken off uncut, except around
the neck, and in those situations necessary to enable the butchers
to draw the legs out of the skin; also, of course, where the first
incision is made to commence the process, and which is a circular
cut carried around both haunches, not many inches from and
having the tail for a centre. The hide is then stripped over the
thighs, and two smaller incisions being made round the middle
joint of the hind-legs enable them to be drawn out.</p>

<p>"A stick is now placed to extend these extremities, and by
this, for the convenience of the operators, the whole carcase is
suspended from the branch of a tree, and, by some easy pulls
around the body, the skin is gradually withdrawn over the fore-legs,
which are incised around the knees, to admit of their being
taken out; after which, the head being removed, the whole business
concludes by the skin being pulled inside out over the
decollated neck. One of the parties now takes a rough stone
and well rubs the inside surface, to divest it of a few fibres of
the subcutaneous muscle which are inserted into the skin, and
after this operation it is laid aside until the next day; the more
interesting business of attending to the meat calling for immediate
attention.</p>

<p>"These entire skins are afterwards made into sacks by the
apertures around the neck and legs being secured by a double
fold of the skin being sewed upon each other, by means of a
slender but very tough thong. These small seams are rendered
quite air-tight, and the larger orifice around the haunches being
gathered together by the hands, the yet raw skin is distended
with air; and the orifice being then tied up, the swollen bag is
left in that state for a few days, until slight putrefaction has
commenced, when the application of the rough stone soon divests
its surface of the hair. After this has been effected, a deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
labour, during at least one day, is required to soften the distended
skin by beating it with heavy sticks, or trampling upon it for
hours together, the labourer supporting himself by clinging to
the bough of a tree overhead, or holding on by the wall of the
house.</p>

<p>"In this manner, whilst the skin is drying, it is prevented
from getting stiff, and, still further to secure it from this evil
condition, it is frequently rubbed with small quantities of butter.
When it is supposed that there is no chance of the skin becoming
hard and easily broken, the orifice is opened, the air escapes, and
a very soft, flaccid leather bag is produced, but which, for several
days after, affords an amusement to the owner, when otherwise
unemployed, by well rubbing it all over with his hands."</p>

<p>The reader will see that the two processes are practically
identical, the chief difference being that in one country the skins
are distended with water and in the other with air.</p>

<p>As these bottles are rather apt to be damaged by the thorns,
branches, rocks, and similar objects with which they come in
contact, and are much too valuable to be thrown away as useless,
their owners have discovered methods of patching and repairing
them, which enable them to be used for some time longer.
Patches of considerable size are sometimes inserted, if the rent
should be of importance, while the wound caused by a thorn is
mended by a simple and efficacious expedient. The skin is first
emptied, and a round flat piece of wood, or even a stone of
suitable shape, is put into it. The skin is then held with the
wounded part downwards, and the stone shaken about until it
comes exactly upon the hole. It is then grasped, the still wet
hide gathered tightly under it, so as to pucker up the skin, and
a ligature is tied firmly round it. Perhaps some of my readers
may have practised the same method of mending a punctured
football.</p>

<p>Allusion to this mode of mending the skin bottles is made in
Josh. ix. 4, 13. The Gibeonites "did work wilily, and went and
made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon
their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up ... and
said ... these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
behold, they be rent."</p>

<p>If these skin bottles be allowed to become dry, as is sometimes
the case when they are hung up in the smoky tents, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
shrivel up, and become rotten and weak, and are no longer
enabled to bear the pressure caused by the fermentation of new
wine. So, in Ps. cxix. 81-83: "My soul fainteth for Thy salvation:
but I hope in Thy word.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 373px;"><a name="carriers" id="carriers"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">EASTERN WATER-CARRIERS WITH BOTTLES MADE OF GOAT-SKIN.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mine eyes fail for Thy word, saying, When wilt Thou comfort
me?</p>

<p>"For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
forget Thy statutes."</p>

<p>How forcible does not this image become, when we realize the
early life of the shepherd poet, his dwelling in tents wherein are
no windows nor chimneys, and in which the smoke rolls to and
fro until it settles in the form of soot upon the leathern bottles
and other rude articles of furniture that are hung from the
poles!</p>

<p>In the New Testament there is a well-known allusion to the
weakness of old bottles: "Neither do men put new wine into
old bottles, or the bottles break and the wine runneth out, and
the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new bottles, and
both are preserved." It would be impossible to understand the
meaning of this passage unless we knew that the "bottles" in
question were not vessels of glass or earthenware, but merely
the partly-tanned skins of goats.</p>

<p>Another allusion to the use of the goat-skin is made in that
part of the Book of Joshua which has already been mentioned.
If the reader will refer to Josh. ix. 4, he will see that the
Gibeonites took with them not only old bottles, but old sacks.
Now, these sacks bore no resemblance to the hempen bags with
which we are so familiar, but were nothing more than the same
goat-skins that were employed in the manufacture of bottles, but
with the opening at the neck left open. They were, in fact,
skin-bottles for holding solids instead of liquids. The sacks
which Joseph's brethren took with them, and in the mouths of
which they found their money, were simply goat-skin bags, made
as described.</p>

<p>Yet another use for the goat-skin. It is almost certain that
the "kneading-troughs" of the ancient Israelites were simply
circular pieces of goat-skin, which could be laid on the ground
when wanted, and rolled up and carried away when out of use.
Thus, the fact that "the people took their dough before it was
leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothing
upon their shoulders," need cause no surprise.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more in accordance with probability. The
women were all hard at work, preparing the bread for the expected
journey, when the terrified Pharaoh "called for Moses and Aaron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my
people, both ye and the children of Israel, and go, serve the
Lord, as ye have said.... And the Egyptians were urgent upon
the people that they might send them out of the land in haste;
for they said, We be all dead men."</p>

<p>So the women, being disturbed at their work, and being driven
out of the country before they had leavened, much less baked,
their bread, had no alternative but to roll up the dough in the
leathern "kneading-troughs," tie them up in a bundle with their
spare clothing, and carry them on their shoulders; whereas, if
we connect the kneading-troughs with the large heavy wooden
implements used in this country, we shall form an entirely
erroneous idea of the proceeding. As soon as they came to their
first halting-place at Succoth, they took the leathern kneading-troughs
out of their clothes, unrolled them, took the dough
which had not even been leavened, so unexpectedly had the order
for marching arrived, made it into flat cakes, and baked them
as they best could. The same kind of "kneading-trough" is
still in use in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>Stone as well as earthenware jars were also used by the
inhabitants of ancient Palestine; but they were only employed
for the storage of wine in houses, whereas the bottles that were
used in carrying wine from one place to another were invariably
made of leather. Water also was stored in stone or earthenware
jars. See, for example, John ii. 6: "And there were set there
six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the
Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece." Whereas, when
it was carried about, it was poured into bottles made of skin.
Such was probably the "bottle of water" that Abraham put
on Hagar's shoulder, when she was driven away by the jealousy
of Sarah, and such was the "bottle of wine" that Hannah brought
as her offering when she dedicated Samuel to the service of
God.</p>

<p>In sacrifices the Goat was in nearly as much requisition as
the lamb, and in one&mdash;namely, that which was celebrated on the
Great Day of Atonement&mdash;the Goat was specially mentioned as
the only animal which could be sacrificed. The reader will,
perhaps, remember that for this peculiar sacrifice two Goats were
required, on which two lots were cast, one for the Lord, <em>i.e.</em> with
the word "Jehovah" upon it, and the other for the scapegoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<em>i.e.</em> inscribed with the word "Azazel." The latter term is derived
from two Hebrew words, the former being "Az," which is the
general name for the Goat, and the second "azel," signifying "he
departed." The former, which belonged to Jehovah, was sacrificed,
and its blood sprinkled upon the mercy-seat and the altar of
incense; and the Goat Azazel was led away into the wilderness,
bearing upon its head the sins of the people, and there let
loose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These being the uses of the Goat, it may naturally be imagined
that the animal is one of extreme importance, and that it is
watched as carefully by its owners as the sheep. Indeed, both
sheep and Goats belong to the same master, and are tended by
the same shepherd, who exercises the same sway over them that
he does over the sheep.</p>

<p>They are, however, erratic animals, and, although they will
follow the shepherd wherever he may lead them, they will not
mix with the sheep. The latter will walk in a compact flock
along the valley, the shepherd leading the way, and the sheep
following him, led in their turn by the sound of the bell tied
round the neck of the master-ram of the flock. The Goats,
however, will not submit to walk in so quiet a manner, but prefer
to climb along the sides of the rocks that skirt the valleys,
skipping and jumping as they go, and seeming to take delight
in getting themselves into dangerous places, where a man could
not venture to set his foot.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the shepherds call their flocks to repose,
they often make use of the caverns which exist at some height
in the precipitous side of the hills, as being safe strongholds,
where the jackal and the hyæna will not venture to attack them.
When such is the case, the shepherds take their station by the
mouth of the cave, and assist the sheep as they come sedately
up the narrow path that leads to the cavern. The Goats, however,
need no assistance, but come scrambling along by paths
where no foot but a Goat's could tread, mostly descending from a
considerable height above the cave, and, as if in exultation at
their superior agility, jumping over the backs of the sheep as
they slowly file into the accustomed fold.</p>

<p>Friendly as they are, the Goats and sheep never mingle
together. There may be large flocks of them feeding in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
pasturage, but the Goats always take the highest spots on which
verdure grows, while the sheep graze quietly below. Goats are
specially fond of the tender shoots of trees, which they find in
plenty upon the mountain side; and, according to Mr. Tristram,
by their continual browsing, they have extirpated many species
of trees which were once common on the hills of Palestine, and
which now can only be found in Lebanon on the east of the
Jordan.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="march" id="march"></a>
<img src="images/i_227.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="march" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">GOATS ON THE MARCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Even when folded together in the same enclosure, the Goats
never mix with the sheep, but gather together by themselves, and
they instinctively take the same order when assembled round the
wells at mid-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>This instinctive separation of the sheep and the goats naturally
recalls to our minds the well-known saying of our Lord that
"before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
the goats: and He shall set the sheep on His right hand, and
the goats on His left."</p>

<p>The image thus used was one that was familiar to all the
hearers, who were accustomed daily to see the herds of sheep
and Goats under one shepherd, yet totally distinct from each other.
At feeding-time the Goats will be browsing in long lines on the
mountain sides, while the sheep are grazing in the plain or
valley; at mid-day, when the flocks are gathered round the wells
to await the rolling away of the stone that guards the water, the
Goats assemble on one side and the sheep on the other. And
at night, when they are all gathered into one fold by one shepherd,
they are still separated from each other. The same image
is employed by the prophet Ezekiel: "As for you, O my flock,
thus said the Lord God, Behold I judge between cattle and
cattle, between rams and the he-goats."</p>

<p>Generally, the leading Goat was distinguished by a bell as
well as the leading sheep, and in reference to this custom there
was an old proverb, "If the shepherd takes the lead, he blinds
the bell-goat," while another proverb is based upon the inferior
docility of the animal&mdash;"If the shepherd be lame, the Goats
will run away."</p>

<p>Yet the Goat can be tamed very effectively, and can even be
taught to perform many tricks. "We saw just below us, on the
rudely-constructed 'parade,' a crowd of men and children, surrounding
a fantastically-dressed man exhibiting a Goat, which
had been tutored to perform some cunning trick. It stood with
its four feet close together on the top of a very long pole, and
allowed the man to lift it up and carry it round and round
within the circle; then the Goat was perched on four sticks, and
again carried about. A little band of music&mdash;pipes, drums, and
tambourines&mdash;called together the people from all parts of the
town to witness this performance.</p>

<p>"The Goat danced and balanced himself obediently and perfectly,
in very unnatural-looking positions, as if thoroughly
understanding the words and commands of his master. The
men who watched the actions of the Goat looked as grave and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
serious as if they were attending a philosophical or scientific
lecture." ("Domestic Life in Palestine," by Miss Rogers.)</p>

<p>Another feat is a favourite with the proprietors of trained
Goats. The man takes a stool and plants it carefully on the
ground, so as to be perfectly level, and then orders the Goat to
stand upon it. A piece of wood about six inches in length, and
shaped something like a dice-box, is then placed on the stool,
and the Goat manages to stand on it, all his sharp, hard hoofs
being pressed closely together on the tiny surface. The man
then takes another piece of wood and holds it to the Goat's feet.
The animal gently removes first one foot and then another, and,
by careful shifting of the feet, enables its master to place the
second piece of wood on the first. Successive additions are
made, until at the last the Goat is perched on the topmost of
some nine or ten pieces of wood balanced on each other, the
whole looking like a stout reed marked off with joints.</p>

<p>The stately steps and bold bearing of the old he-goat is
mentioned in the Proverbs: "There be three things which go
well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>

<p>"A lion, which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not
away for any;</p>

<p>"A greyhound; an he-goat also; and a king, against whom
there is no rising up." (Prov. xxx. 29-31.) The word which is
here rendered as he-goat signifies literally the "Butter," and is
given to the animal on account of the mode in which it uses its
formidable horns. The word is not common in the Bible, but it
is used even at the present day among the Arabs.</p>

<p>Several herds of goats exist in Palestine, the most valuable of
which is the Mohair Goat, and the most common the Syrian
Goat. These, however dissimilar they may be in appearance,
are only varieties of the ordinary domestic animal, the former
being produced artificially by carefully selecting those specimens
for breeding which have the longest and finest hair. It was from
the hair of this breed that the costly fabrics used in the Tabernacle
were woven, and it is probably to this breed that reference
is made in Solomon's Song, iv. 1, 2: "Behold, thou art fair,
my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy
locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Mount
Gilead.</p>

<p>"Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a><br /><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
came up from the washing." In this passage the careful reader
will also note another reference to the habits of the Goats and
sheep, the hair being compared to the dark-haired Goats that
wander on the tops of the hills, while the teeth are compared to
sheep that are ranged in regular order below. The Mohair Goat
is known scientifically as <em>Capra Angorensis</em>. The same image is
used again in chap. vi. 5.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 333px;"><a name="attacked" id="attacked"></a>
<img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="333" height="600" alt="attacked" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HERD OF GOATS ATTACKED BY A LION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The second breed is that which is commonest throughout the
country. It is known by the name of the Syrian Goat, and is
remarkable for the enormous length of its ears, which sometimes
exceed a foot from root to tip. This variety has been described
as a separate species under the name of <em>Capra Mambrica</em>, or
<em>C. Syriaca</em>, but, like the Mohair Goat, and twenty-three other
so-called species, is simply a variety of the common Goat, <em>Hircus
ægragus</em>.</p>

<p>Reference is made to the long ears of the Syrian Goat in
Amos iii. 12: "Thus saith the Lord: As the shepherd taketh
out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so
shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria."
Such a scene, which was familiar to Amos, the shepherd as
well as the prophet, is represented in the illustration. In the
foreground is the goat on which the lion has sprung, and from
which one of the long ears has been torn away. Its companions
are gathering round it in sympathy, while its kid is trying to
discover the cause of its mother's uneasiness. In the background
is a group of armed shepherds, standing round the lion which
they have just killed, while one of them is holding up the torn
ear which he has taken out of the lion's mouth.</p>

<h2>THE WILD GOAT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Azelim or Wild Goats of Scripture identical with the Beden or Arabian Ibex&mdash;Different
names of the Beden&mdash;Its appearance and general habits&mdash;En-gedi, or
Goats' Fountain&mdash;The Beden formerly very plentiful in Palestine, and now
tolerably common&mdash;Its agility&mdash;Difficulty of catching or killing it&mdash;How the
young are captured&mdash;Flesh of the Beden&mdash;Use of the horns at the present day&mdash;The
Ako of Deuteronomy.</p></blockquote>


<p>In three passages of the Old Testament occurs a word, "Azelim,"
which is variously translated in our Authorized Version.</p>

<p>It is first seen in 1 Sam. xxiv. 2, in which it is rendered as
"Wild Goats." "It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is in
the wilderness of En-gedi [<em>i.e.</em> the Fountain of the Goat]. Then
Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went
to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats
(<em>azelim</em>)." The same word occurs in Job xxxix. 1: "Knowest
thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?"
It is also found in Ps. civ. 18: "The high hills are a refuge for
the wild goats." In all these passages it is rendered as "wild
goats." But, in Prov. v. 19, it is translated as roe: "Rejoice
with the wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and
pleasant roe (<em>azelah</em>)." The Jewish Bible follows the same
diverse renderings.</p>

<p>We now have to discover the animal which was signified by
the word Azel. According to its etymology, it is the Climber,
just as the adult he-goat is called the Butter.</p>

<p>That it was a climbing animal is evident from its name, and
that it loved to clamber among precipices is equally evident
from the repeated connexion of the word rock with the name of
the animal. We also see, from the passage in Job, that it is a
wild animal whose habits were not known. There is scarcely
any doubt that the Azel of the Old Testament is the <span class="smcap">Arabian
Ibex</span> or <span class="smcap">Beden</span> (<em>Capra Nubiana</em>). This animal is very closely
allied to the well-known Ibex of the Alps, or Steinbock, but
may be distinguished from it by one or two slight differences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
such as the black beard and the slighter make of the horns,
which moreover have three angles instead of four, as is the case
with the Alpine Ibex.</p>

<p>The Beden is known by several names. It is sometimes
called the Jaela, sometimes the Nubian Wild Goat, and is also
known as the Wild Goat of Sinai. The general colour of the
Beden is grey, becoming brownish in winter, and being whitish
grey beneath. The feet are spotted with black and white, and
the beard of the male is black, differing from that of the Alpine
Ibex, which is brown. The female is beardless. The lines along
the back and the sides of the tail are black, and there are three
streaks on each ear.</p>

<p>The Beden generally lives in little herds of eight or ten, and
is even now to be found in Palestine. At the strange, wild,
weird-looking En-gedi (Ain Jiddy), or Fountain of the Goats,
the Beden is still to be seen. Mr. Tristram suggests that David
and his followers took up their residence at En-gedi for the sake
of the Wild Goats that were plentiful upon the spot, and which
would furnish food for himself and his hardy band of outlaws.
"In the neighbourhood of En-gedi," remarks this traveller,
"while encamped by the Dead Sea shore, we obtained several
fine specimens, and very interesting it was to find the graceful
creature by the very fountain to which it gave name.</p>

<p>"When clambering over the heights above En-gedi, I often,
by the help of my glass, saw the Ibex from a distance, and once,
when near Mar-saba, only a few miles from Jerusalem, started
one at a distance of four hundred yards. At the south end of
the Dead Sea they were common, and I have picked up a horn
both near Jericho on the hills and also on the hills of Moab on
the eastern side. At Jericho, too, I obtained a young one which
I hoped to rear, but which died after I had had it for ten days,
owing, I believe, to the milk with which it was fed being sour.
Further north and west we did not find it, though I have reason
to believe that a few linger on the mountains between Samaria
and the Jordan, and perhaps also on some of the spurs of
Lebanon. We found its teeth in the breccia of bone occurring in
the Lebanon, proving its former abundance there."</p>

<p>As the Beden was found so plentifully even in these days
when fire-arms have rendered many wild animals scarce and
wary, so that they will not show themselves within range of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
bullet, it is evident that in the time when David lived at En-gedi
and drank of the Goats' Fountain they were far more numerous,
and could afford nourishment to him and his soldiers. Travellers,
moreover, who do not happen to be experienced hunters, will
often fail in seeing the Beden, even in places where it is tolerably
plentiful. The colour of its coat resembles so nearly that of the
rocks, that an inexperienced eye would see nothing but bare
stones and sticks where a practised hunter would see numbers
of Beden, conspicuous by their beautifully curved horns.</p>

<p>The agility of the Beden is extraordinary. Loving the highest
and most craggy parts of the mountain ridge, it flings itself from
spot to spot with a recklessness that startles one who has not
been accustomed to the animal, and the wonderful certainty of
its foot. It will, for example, dash at the face of a perpendicular
precipice that looks as smooth as a brick wall, for the purpose
of reaching a tiny ledge which is hardly perceptible, and which
is some fifteen feet or so above the spot whence the animal
sprang. Its eye, however, has marked certain little cracks and
projections on the face of the rock, and as the animal makes its
leap, it takes these little points of vantage in rapid succession,
just touching them as it passes upwards, and by the slight stroke
of its foot keeping up the original impulse of its leap. Similarly,
the Ibex comes sliding and leaping down precipitous sides of
the mountains, sometimes halting with all the four feet drawn
together, on a little projection scarcely larger than a penny, and
sometimes springing boldly over a wide crevasse, and alighting
with exact precision upon a projecting piece of rock that seems
scarcely large enough to sustain a rat comfortably.</p>

<p>The young of the Ibex are sometimes captured and tamed.
They are, however, difficult to rear, and give much more trouble
than the young gazelles when taken in a similar manner. The
natives can generally procure the kids at the proper time of
year, and sell them at a very cheap rate. They seldom, however,
can be reared, and even those who live in the country experience
the greatest difficulty in keeping the young Beden alive until
it attains maturity.</p>

<p>Were it not for the curious habits of the Beden, the young
could scarcely ever be obtained alive, as they are so agile that
they could easily leap away from their slow two-legged pursuers.
But the mother Ibex has a habit of leading a very independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
life, wandering to considerable distances, and leaving her kid
snugly hidden in some rock-cleft. The hunters watch the
mother as she starts off in the morning, clamber up to the
spot where the kid is concealed, and secure it without difficulty.
The Arabs say that there are always two kids at a birth, but
there is considerable discrepancy of evidence on this point,
which, after all, is of very little importance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ARABIAN IBEX, OR BEDEN; THE WILD GOAT OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The flesh of the Beden is really excellent. It is far superior
to that of the gazelle, which is comparatively dry and hard, and
it has been happily suggested that the Beden was the animal in
search of which Esau was sent to hunt with his quiver and his
bow, and which furnished the "savoury meat" which Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
loved. None but a true hunter can hope to secure the Beden,
and even all the knowledge, patience, and energy of the best
hunters are tried before they can kill their prey. It was therefore
no matter of wonder that Isaac should be surprised when
he thought that he heard Esau return so soon from the hunting-grounds.
"How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my
son?"</p>

<p>There are few animals more wary than the Beden, and even
the chamois of the Alps does not exercise the finest qualities of
a hunter more than does the Beden of Palestine. It is gifted
with very keen eyes, which can discern the approach of an
enemy long before its grey coat and curved horns can be distinguished
from the stones and gnarled boughs of the mountain
side. And, even if the enemy be not within range of the animal's
sight, its nostrils are so keen that it can detect a man by scent
alone at a considerable distance. Like all gregarious animals,
the Beden insures the safety of the flock by stationing sentries,
which are posted on places that command the whole surrounding
country, and to deceive the watchful senses of these wary
guardians tests all the qualities of the hunter.</p>

<p>The dawn of day is the time that is generally chosen for
approaching a herd, because the animals are then feeding, and
if the hunter can manage to approach them against the wind, he
may chance to come within range. Should however the wind
change its direction, he may quietly walk home again, for at the
first breath of the tainted gale the sentinels utter their shrill
whistle of alarm, and the whole party dash off with a speed that
renders pursuit useless.</p>

<p>The horns of the Beden are of very great size, and from their
bold curves, with the large rings and ridges which cover their
front, are remarkably handsome objects. In their own country
they are in great request as handles to knives, and even in
England they may be occasionally seen serving as handles
to carving-knives and forks.</p>

<p>As to the word Ako, which occurs in Deut. xiv. 5, together
with other animals, and is rendered as "Wild Goat," there is
so much doubt about the correct translation that I can do no
more than mention that the Jewish Bible follows our authorized
edition in translating Ako as Wild Goat, but adds the doubtful
mark to the word.</p>

<h2>THE DEER.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Hart and Hind of Scripture&mdash;Species of Deer existing in Palestine&mdash;Earliest
mention of the Hind&mdash;The Hart classed among the clean animals&mdash;Passages
alluding to its speed&mdash;Care of the mother for her young, and her custom of

<p>We now come to the <span class="smcap">Deer</span> which are mentioned in Scripture.
There are not many passages in which they are mentioned, and
one of them is rather doubtful, as we shall see when we come
to it.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the two words <span class="smcap">Hart</span> and <span class="smcap">Hind</span> (in the
Hebrew <em>Ayzal</em> and <em>Ayzalah</em>) represent Deer of some kind, and
the question is to find out what kind of Deer is signified by
these words. I think that we may safely determine that no
particular species is meant, but that under the word Ayzal are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
comprehended any
kinds of Deer that
inhabit Palestine,
and were likely to
be known to those to whom the
earlier Scriptures were addressed.
That some kind of Deer was plentiful
is evident from the references which are made to
it, and specially by the familiar word Ajala or Ayala,
as it is pronounced, which signifies the Deer-ground or
pasture. But the attempt to discriminate between one species and
another is simply impossible, and the more careful the search the
more impracticable the task appears.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="red" id="red"></a>
<img src="images/i_238.jpg" width="400" height="497" alt="red" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">RED DEER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As far as can be ascertained, at least two kinds of Deer inhabited
Palestine in the earlier days of the Jewish history, one
belonging to the division which is known by its branched
horns, and the other to that in which the horns are flat or palmated
over the tips. Examples of both kinds are familiar to us
under the titles of the <span class="smcap">Red Deer</span> and the <span class="smcap">Fallow Deer</span>, and it
is tolerably certain that both these animals were formerly found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in Palestine, or that at all events the Deer which did exist there
were so closely allied to them as to be mere varieties occasioned
by the different conditions in which they were placed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now proceed to the various passages in which the
Hart and Hind are mentioned in the Bible.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="hind" id="hind"></a>
<img src="images/i_239.jpg" width="400" height="481" alt="hind" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">FALLOW-DEER, OR HIND OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As might be expected, we come upon it among the number of
the beasts which divided the hoof and chewed the cud, and
were specially indicated as fit for food; see Deut. xii. 15:
"Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
... the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck,
and as of the hart."</p>

<p>There is, however, an earlier mention of the word in Gen.
xlix. 21. It occurs in that splendid series of imagery in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a><br /><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Jacob blesses his sons, and prophesies their future, each image
serving ever afterwards as the emblem of the tribe: "Naphtali
is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words;"&mdash;or, according to
the Jewish Bible, "Naphtali is a hind sent forth: he giveth
sayings of pleasantness." Now, such an image as this would
never have been used, had not the spectacle of the "hind let
loose" been perfectly familiar to the eyes both of the dying
patriarch and his hearers, and equally so with the lion, the ass,
the vine, the serpent, and other objects used emblematically in
the same prophetic poem.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A QUIET SPOT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The excellence of the Hart's flesh is shown by its occurrence
among the animals used for King Solomon's table: see 1 Kings
iv. 23, a passage which has been quoted several times, and
therefore need only be mentioned.</p>

<p>Allusion is made to the speed and agility of the Deer in
several passages. See, for example, Isa. xxxv. 6: "Then shall
the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb
sing." Again, in 2 Sam. xxii. 33, 34: "God is my strength and
power: and He maketh my way perfect.</p>

<p>"He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon
my high places."</p>

<p>Nearly four hundred years afterwards we find Habakkuk
using precisely the same image, evidently quoting David's Psalm
of Thanksgiving:&mdash;"Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
the God of my salvation.</p>

<p>"The Lord God is my strength, and He will make my feet
like hinds' feet, and He will make me to walk upon mine high
places." (iii. 18, 19.)</p>

<p>A passage of a similar character may be found in Solomon's
Song, ii. 8, 9: "The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh
leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>

<p>"My beloved is like a roe or a young hart."</p>

<p>There is one passage in the Psalms which is familiar to us in
many ways, and not the least in that it has been chosen as the
text for so many well-known anthems. "As the hart panteth
after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.</p>

<p>"My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
come and appear before God?" (Ps. xlii. 1, 2.)</p>

<p>Beautiful as this passage is, it cannot be fully understood
without the context.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>David wrote this psalm before he had risen to royal power,
and while he was fleeing from his enemies from place to place,
and seeking an uncertain shelter in the rock-caves. In verse 6
he enumerates some of the spots in which he has been forced to
reside, far away from the altar, the priests, and the sacrifice.
He has been hunted about from place to place by his enemies
as a stag is hunted by the hounds, and his very soul thirsted
for the distant Tabernacle, in which the Shekinah, the visible
presence of God, rested on the mercy-seat between the golden
cherubim.</p>

<p>Wild and unsettled as was the early life of David, this was
ever the reigning thought in his mind, and there is scarcely a
psalm that he wrote in which we do not find some allusion
to the visible presence of God among men. No matter what
might be the troubles through which he had to pass, even
though he trod the valley of the shadow of death, the thought
of his God was soothing as water to the hunted stag, and in
that thought he ever found repose. Through all his many trials
and adversities, through his deep remorse for his sins, through
his wounded paternal affections, through his success and prosperity,
that one thought is the ruling power. He begins his
career with it when he opposed Goliath: "Thou comest to me
with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come
to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies
of Israel." He closes his career with the same thought, and, in
the "last words" that are recorded, he charged his son to keep
the commandments of the Lord, that he might do wisely all that
he did.</p>

<p>We now come to another point in the Deer's character;
namely, the watchful care of the mother over her young. She
always retires to some secret place when she instinctively
knows that the birth is at hand, and she hides it from all eyes
until it is able to take care of itself. By some strange instinct,
the little one, almost as soon as it is born, is able to comprehend
the signals of its mother, and there is an instance, well known
to naturalists, where a newly-born Deer, hardly an hour old,
crouched low to the earth in obedience to a light tap on its
shoulder from its mother's hoof. She, with the intense watchfulness
of her kind, had seen a possible danger, and so warned
her young one to hide itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 399px;"><a name="leader" id="leader"></a>
<img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="399" height="600" alt="leader" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LEADER OF THE HERD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is scarcely any animal so watchful as the female Deer,
as all hunters know by practical experience. It is comparatively
easy to deceive the stag who leads the herd, but to evade the
eyes and ears of the hinds is a very different business, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
taxes all the resources of a practised hunter. If they take such
care of the herd in general, it may be imagined that their
watchfulness would be multiplied tenfold when the object of
their anxiety is their own young.</p>

<p>It is in allusion to this well-known characteristic that a
passage in the Book of Job refers: "Knowest thou the time
when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark
when the hinds do calve?" (xxxix. 1.) A similar image is used
in Psa. xxix. 9. After enumerating the wonders that are done
by the voice of the Lord, the thunders and rain torrents,
the devastating tempests, the forked lightning, and the earthquake
"that shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh," the Psalmist
proceeds: "The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve,
and discovereth the forests,"&mdash;this being as mysterious to the
writer as the more conspicuous wonders which he had previously
mentioned.</p>

<p>So familiar to the Hebrews was the watchful care which the
female Deer exercised over her young, that it forms the subject
of a powerful image in one of Jeremiah's mournful prophecies:
"Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because
there was no grass." (xiv. 5.) To those who understand the habits
of the animal, this is a most telling and picturesque image. In
the first place, the Hind, a wild animal that could find food
where less active creatures would starve, was reduced to such
straits that she was obliged to remain in the fields at the time
when her young was born, instead of retiring to some sheltered
spot, according to her custom. And when it was born, instead
of nurturing it carefully, according to the natural maternal
instinct, she was forced from sheer hunger to abandon it in
order to find a sufficiency of food for herself.</p>

<p>That the Deer could be tamed, and its naturally affectionate
disposition cultivated, is evident from a passage in the Proverbs
(v. 18, 19): "Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the
wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant
roe."</p>

<p>We might naturally expect that the Rabbinical writers would
have much to say on the subject of the Hart and Hind. Among
much that is irrelevant to the object of the present work there
are a few passages that deserve mention. Alluding to the
annual shedding of the Deer's horns, there is a proverb respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
one who ventures his money too freely in trade, that "he has
hung it on the stag's horns," meaning thereby that he will never
see it again. It is remarkable that in Western Africa there is a
proverb of a similar character, the imprudent merchant being told
to look for his money in the place where Deer shed their horns.</p>

<h2>THE CAMEL.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The two species of Camel, and the mode of distinguishing them&mdash;Value of the
Camel in the East&mdash;Thirst-enduring capability&mdash;The hump, and its use to the
animal&mdash;The Camel as a beast of draught and burden&mdash;How the Camel is laden&mdash;Camels
for riding&mdash;Difficulty of sitting a Camel&mdash;A rough-paced steed&mdash;Method
of guiding the Camel&mdash;The swift dromedary&mdash;Young Camels and their appearance&mdash;The
deserted Camel.</p></blockquote>


<p>Before treating of the Scriptural references to the Camel, it
will be as well to clear the ground by noticing that two distinct
species of Camel are known to zoologists; namely, the common
Camel (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>), which has one hump, and the
Bactrian Camel (<em>Camelus Bactrianus</em>), which has two of these
curious projections. There is a popular but erroneous idea that
the dromedary and the Camel are two distinct animals, the latter
being distinguished by its huge hump, whereas the fact is, that
the dromedary is simply a lighter and more valuable breed of
the one-humped Camel of Arabia, the two-humped Bactrian
Camel being altogether a different animal, inhabiting Central
Asia, Thibet, and China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The Camel is still one of the most valued animals that inhabit
Palestine, and in former times it played a part in Jewish history
scarcely inferior to that of the ox or sheep. We shall, therefore,
devote some space to it.</p>

<p>In some parts of the land it even exceeded in value the
sheep, and was infinitely more useful than the goat. At the
very beginning of Jewish history we read of this animal, and it
is mentioned in the New Testament nearly two thousand years
after we meet with it in the Book of Genesis. The earliest
mention of the Camel occurs in Gen. xii. 16, where is related
the journey of Abram: "He had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses,
and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="returns" id="returns"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JACOB LEAVES LABAN AND RETURNS TO CANAAN WITH HIS CAMELS, SHEEP, AND CATTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Belonging, as he did, to the nomad race which lives almost
wholly on the produce of their herds, Abram needed Camels,
not only for their milk, and, for all we know, for their flesh, but
for their extreme use as beasts of burden, without which he
could never have travelled over that wild and pathless land.
The whole of Abram's outer life was exactly that of a Bedouin
sheikh of the present day, in whom we find reproduced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
habits, the tone of thought, and the very verbiage of the ancient
Scriptures.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, when the son of his old age was
desirous of marrying a wife of his own kindred, we find that he
sent his trusted servants with ten of his Camels to Mesopotamia,
and it was by the offering of water to these Camels, that Rebekah
was selected as Isaac's wife (see Gen. xxiv. 10, 19). In after
days, when Jacob was about to leave Laban, these animals are
mentioned as an important part of his wealth: "And the man
increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maid-servants,
and men-servants, and camels, and asses" (Gen. xxx. 43).</p>

<p>It is thought worthy of mention in the sacred narrative that
Job had three thousand, and afterwards six thousand Camels
(Job i. 3, and xlii. 12); that the Midianites and Amalekites possessed
camels without number, as the sand by the seaside.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="camp" id="camp"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A CAMP IN THE DESERT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>They were valuable enough to be sent as presents from one
potentate to another. For example, when Jacob went to meet
Esau, he gave as his present two hundred and twenty sheep, the
same number of goats, fifty oxen, thirty asses, and sixty camels,
i.e. thirty mothers, each with her calf. They were important
enough to be guarded by men of position. In 1 Chron. xxvii. 30,
we find that the charge of David's Camels was confided to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of his officers, Obil the Ishmaelite, who, from his origin, might
be supposed to be skilful in the management of these animals.
Bochart, however, conjectures that the word Obil ought to be
read as Abal, <em>i.e.</em> the camel-keeper, and that the passage would
therefore read as follows: "Over the camels was an Ishmaelitish
camel-keeper."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now proceed to the uses of the Camel, and first take
it in the light of food.</p>

<p>By the Mosaic law, the Camel was a forbidden animal, because
it did not divide the hoof, although it chewed the cud.
Yet, although the Jews might not eat its flesh, they probably
used the milk for food, as they do at the present day. No
distinct Scriptural reference is made to the milk of the Camel;
but, as the Jews of the present day are quite as fastidious as
their ancestors in keeping the Mosaic law, we are justified in
concluding that, although they would not eat the flesh of the
animal, they drank its milk. At the present time, the milk is
used, like that of the sheep, goat, and cow, both in a fresh and
curdled state, the latter being generally preferred to the former.
A kind of cheese is made from it, but is not much to the taste
of the European traveller, on account of the quantity of salt
which is put in it. Butter is churned in a very simple manner,
the fresh milk being poured into a skin bag, and the bag beaten
with a stick until the butter makes its appearance.</p>

<p>That it was really used in the patriarchal times is evident
by the passage which has already been mentioned, where Jacob
is related to have brought as a present to his brother Esau thirty
milch Camels, together with their young. So decided a stress
would certainly not have been laid upon the fact that the animals
were milch Camels unless the milk were intended for use.</p>

<p>Perhaps the use of the Camel's milk might be justified by
saying that the prohibition extended only to eating and not to
drinking, and that therefore the milk might be used though the
flesh was prohibited.</p>

<p>There was another mode in which the Camel might be used
by travellers to sustain life.</p>

<p>The reader is probably aware that, even in the burning climate
in which it dwells, the Camel is able to go for a long time without
drinking,&mdash;not that it requires less liquid nourishment than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
other animals, but that it is able, by means of its internal construction,
to imbibe at one draught a quantity of water which
will last for a considerable time. It is furnished with a series of
cells, into which the water runs as fast as it is drunk, and in which
it can be kept for some time without losing its life-preserving
qualities. As much as twenty gallons have been imbibed by a
Camel at one draught, and this amount will serve it for several
days, as it has the power of consuming by degrees the water
which it has drunk in a few minutes.</p>

<p>This curious power of the Camel has often proved to be the
salvation of its owner. It has often happened that, when
travellers have been passing over the desert, their supply of
water has been exhausted, partly by the travellers and partly by
the burning heat which causes it to evaporate through the pores
of the goat-skin bottle in which it was carried. Then the next
well, where they had intended to refill their skins and refresh
themselves, has proved dry, and the whole party seemed doomed
to die of thirst.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, only one chance of escape is left
them. They kill a Camel, and from its stomach they procure
water enough to sustain life for a little longer, and perhaps to
enable them to reach a well or fountain in which water still
remains. The water which is thus obtained is unaltered, except
by a greenish hue, the result of mixing with the remains of
herbage in the cells. It is, of course, very disagreeable, but
those who are dying from thirst cannot afford to be fastidious,
and to them the water is a most delicious draught.</p>

<p>It is rather curious that, if any of the water which is taken
out of a dead Camel can be kept for a few days, both the green
hue and the unpleasant flavour disappear, and the water
becomes fresh, clear, and limpid. So wonderfully well do the
internal cells preserve the water, that after a Camel has been
dead for ten days&mdash;and in that hot climate ten days after death
are equal to a month here&mdash;the water within it has been quite
pure and drinkable.</p>

<p>Many persons believe in the popular though erroneous idea
that the Camel does not require as much water as ordinary
animals. He will see, however, from the foregoing account that
it needs quite as much water as the horse or the ox, but that it
possesses the capability of taking in at one time as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a><br /><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
either of these animals would drink in several days. So far
from being independent of water, there is no animal that requires
it more, or displays a stronger desire for it. A thirsty Camel
possesses the power of scenting water at a very great distance,
and, when it does so, its instincts conquer its education, and it
goes off at full speed towards the spot, wholly ignoring its rider
or driver. Many a desert spring has been discovered, and many
a life saved, by this wonderful instinct, the animal having
scented the distant water when its rider had lost all hope, and
was resigning himself to that terrible end, the death by thirst.
The sacred Zemzem fountain at Mecca was discovered by two
thirsty Camels.</p>

</div>

<p>Except by the Jews, the flesh of the Camel is eaten throughout
Palestine and the neighbouring countries, and is looked upon as
a great luxury. The Arab, for example, can scarcely have a
greater treat than a Camel-feast, and looks forward to it in a state
of wonderful excitement. He is so impatient, that scarcely is
the animal dead before it is skinned, cut up, and the various
parts prepared for cooking.</p>

<p>To European palates the flesh of the Camel is rather unpleasant,
being tough, stringy, and without much flavour. The
fatty hump is universally considered as the best part of the
animal, and is always offered to the chief among the guests, just
as the North American Indian offers the hump of the bison to
the most important man in the assembly. The heart and the
tongue, however, are always eatable, and, however old a Camel
may be, these parts can be cooked and eaten without fear.</p>

<p>The hump, or "bunch" as it is called in the Bible, has no
connexion with the spine, and is a supplementary growth, which
varies in size, not only in the species, but in the individual. It
is analogous to the hump upon the shoulders of the American
bison and the Indian zebra, and in the best-bred Camels it is the
smallest though the finest and most elastic.</p>

<p>This hump, by the way, affords one of the points by which the
value of the Camel is decided. When it is well fed and properly
cared for, the hump projects boldly, and is firm and elastic to
the touch. But if the Camel be ill, or if it be badly fed or overworked,
the hump becomes soft and flaccid, and in bad cases
hangs down on one side like a thick flap of skin. Consequently,
the dealers in Camels always try to produce their animals in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
market with their humps well developed; and, if they find that
this important part does not look satisfactory, they use various
means to give it the required fulness, inflating it with air
being the most common. In fact, there is as much deception
among Camel-dealers in Palestine as with dog or pigeon fanciers
in England.</p>

<p>Here perhaps I may remark that the hump has given rise to
some strange but prevalent views respecting the Camel. Many
persons think that the dromedary has one hump and the Camel
two&mdash;in fact, that they are two totally distinct animals. Now
the fact is that the Camel of Palestine is of one species only,
the dromedary being a lighter and swifter breed, and differing
from the ordinary Camel just as a hunter or racer differs from
a cart-horse. The two-humped Camel is a different species
altogether, which will be briefly described at the end of the
present article.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Camel is also used as a beast of draught, and, as we find,
not only from the Scriptures, but from ancient monuments, was
employed to draw chariots and drag the plough. Thus in Isa.
xxi. 7: "And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a
chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels." It is evident that in
this passage some chariots were drawn by Camels and some by
asses. It is, however, remarkable that in Kennard's "Eastern
Experiences", these two very useful animals are mentioned as
being yoked together: "We passed through a fertile country,
watching the fellaheen at their agricultural labours, and not a
little amused at sometimes remarking a very tall camel and a
very small donkey yoked together in double harness, dragging a
plough through the rich brown soil." Camels drawing chariots
are still to be seen in the Assyrian sculptures. In Palestine&mdash;at
all events at the present time&mdash;the Camel is seldom if ever
used as a beast of draught, being exclusively employed for bearing
burdens and carrying riders.</p>

<p>Taking it first as a beast of burden, we find several references
in different parts of the Scriptures. For example, see 2 Kings
viii. 9: "So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with
him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels'
burden." Again, in 1 Chron. xii. 40: "Moreover they that were
nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on
oxen." Another allusion to the same custom is made in Isaiah:
"They will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses,
and their treasures upon the bunches (or humps) of camels."</p>

<p>The Camel can carry a considerable load, though not so much
as is generally fancied. A sort of a pack-saddle of a very
simple description is used, in order to keep the burden upon so
strangely-shaped an animal. A narrow bag about eight feet
long is made, and rather loosely stuffed with straw or similar
material. It is then doubled, and the ends firmly sewn together,
so as to form a great ring, which is placed over the hump, and
forms a tolerably flat surface. A wooden framework is tied on
the pack-saddle, and is kept in its place by a girth and a
crupper. The packages which the Camel is to carry are
fastened together by cords, and slung over the saddle. They are
only connected by those semi-knots called "hitches," so that,
when the Camel is to be unloaded, all that is needed is to pull
the lower end of the rope, and the packages fall on either side of
the animal. So quickly is the operation of loading performed,
that a couple of experienced men can load a Camel in very little
more than a minute.</p>

<p>As is the case with the horse in England, the Camels that are
used as beasts of burden are of a heavier, slower, and altogether
inferior breed to those which are employed to carry riders, and
all their accoutrements are of a ruder and meaner order, devoid
of the fantastic ornaments with which Oriental riders are fond
of decorating their favourite animals.</p>

<p>In the large illustration are represented four of the ordinary
Camels of burden, as they appear when laden with boughs for
the Feast of Tabernacles. The branches are those of the Hebrew
pine, and, as may be seen, the animals are so heavily laden with
them that their forms are quite hidden under their leafy
burdens. The weight which a Camel will carry varies much,
according to the strength of the individual, which has given rise
to the Oriental proverb, "As the camel, so the load." But an
animal of ordinary strength is supposed to be able to carry from
five to six hundred pounds for a short journey, and half as much
for a long one,&mdash;a quantity which, as the reader will see, is not
so very great when the bulk of the animal is taken into consideration.
It is remarkable that the Camel knows its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a><br /><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
powers, and instinctively refuses to move if its correct load
be exceeded. But, when it is properly loaded, it will carry its
burden for hours together at exactly the same pace, and without
seeming more fatigued than it was when it started.</p>

<p>The riding Camels are always of a better breed than those
which are used for burden, and maybe divided into two classes;
namely, those which are meant for ordinary purposes, and those
which are specially bred for speed and endurance. There is as
much difference between the ordinary riding Camel and the
swift Camel as there is between the road hack and the race-horse.
We will first begin with the description of the common
riding Camel and its accoutrements.</p>

<p>The saddle which is intended for a rider is very different from
the pack-saddle on which burdens are carried, and has a long
upright projection in front, to which the rider can hold if he
wishes it.</p>

<p>The art of riding the Camel is far more difficult of accomplishment
than that of riding the horse, and the preliminary
operation of mounting is not the least difficult portion of it. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
course, to mount a Camel while the animal is standing is impossible,
and accordingly it is taught to kneel until the rider is
seated. Kneeling is a natural position with the Camel, which
is furnished with large callosities or warts on the legs and
breast, which act as cushions on which it may rest its great
weight without abrading the skin. These callosities are not
formed, as some have imagined, by the constant kneeling to
which the Camel is subjected, but are born with it, though of
course less developed than they are after they have been hardened
by frequent pressure against the hot sand.</p>

<p>When the Camel kneels, it first drops on its knees, and then
on the joints of the hind legs. Next it drops on its breast, and
then again on the bent hind legs. In rising it reverses the process,
so that a novice is first pitched forward, then backward,
then forward, and then backward again, to the very great disarrangement
of his garments, and the probable loss of his seat
altogether. Then when the animal kneels he is in danger
of being thrown over its head by the first movement, and jerked
over its tail by the second; but after a time he learns to keep
his seat mechanically.</p>

<p>As to the movement of the animal, it is at first almost as
unpleasant as can be conceived, and has been described by several
travellers, some of whose accounts will be here given. One
well-known traveller declares that any person desiring to practise
Camel-riding can readily do so by taking a music-stool,
screwing it up as high as possible, putting it into a cart without
springs, sitting on the top of it cross-legged, and having
the cart driven at full speed transversely over a newly-ploughed
field.</p>

<p>There is, however, as great a difference in the gait of Camels
as of horses, some animals having a quiet, regular, easy movement,
while others are rough and high-stepping, harassing their
riders grievously in the saddle. Even the smooth-going Camel
is, however, very trying at first, on account of its long swinging
strides, which are taken with the legs of each side alternately,
causing the body of the rider to swing backwards and forwards
as if he were rowing in a boat.</p>

<p>Those who suffer from sea-sickness are generally attacked with
the same malady when they make their first attempts at Camel-riding,
while even those who are proof against this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
form of discomfort soon begin to find that their backs are
aching, and that the pain becomes steadily worse. Change of
attitude is but little use, and the wretched traveller derives but
scant comfort from the advice of his guide, who tells him to
allow his body to swing freely, and that in a short time he will
become used to it. Some days, however, are generally consumed
before he succeeds in training his spine to the continual unaccustomed
movement, and he finds that, when he wakes on
the morning that succeeds his first essay, his back is so stiff
that he can scarcely move without screaming with pain, and
that the prospect of mounting the Camel afresh is anything but
a pleasant one.</p>

<p>"I tried to sit erect without moving," writes Mr. Kennard,
when describing his experience of Camel-riding. "This proved
a relief for a few minutes, but, finding the effort too great to
continue long in this position, I attempted to recline with my
head resting upon my hand. This last man&oelig;uvre I found would
not do, for the motion of the camel's hind legs was so utterly at
variance with the motion of his fore-legs that I was jerked upwards,
and forwards, and sideways, and finally ended in nearly
rolling off altogether.</p>

<p>"Without going into the details of all that I suffered for the
next two or three days&mdash;how that on several occasions I slid
from the camel's back to the ground, in despair of ever accustoming
my half-dislocated joints to the ceaseless jerking and
swaying to and fro, and how that I often determined to trudge
on foot over the hot desert sand all the way to Jerusalem rather
than endure it longer&mdash;I shall merely say that the day did at
last arrive when I descended from my camel, after many hours'
riding, in as happy and comfortable a state of mind as if I had
been lolling in the easiest of arm-chairs."</p>

<p>A very similar description of the transition from acute and
constant suffering to perfect ease is given by Albert Smith, who
states that more than once he has dozed on the back of his
Camel, in spite of the swaying backwards and forwards to
which his body was subjected.</p>

<p>If such be the discomfort of riding a smooth-going and good-tempered
Camel, it may be imagined that to ride a hard-going
and cross-grained animal must be a very severe trial to an inexperienced
rider. A very amusing account of a ride on such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a><br /><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Camel, and of a fall from its back, is given by Mr. Hamilton in
his "Sinai, the Hedjaz, and Soudan:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"A dromedary I had obtained at Suk Abu Sin for my own
riding did not answer my expectations, or rather the saddle was
badly put on&mdash;not an easy thing to do well, by the way&mdash;and
one of my servants, who saw how out of patience I was at the
many times I had had to dismount to have it arranged, persuaded
me to try the one he was riding, the Sheik's present. I had my
large saddle transferred to his beast, and, nothing doubting,
mounted it.</p>

<p>"He had not only no nose-string, but was besides a vicious
brute, rising with a violent jerk before I was well in the saddle,
and anxious to gain the caravan, which was a little way ahead,
he set off at his roughest gallop. Carpets, kufieh, tarbush, all
went off in the jolting; at every step I was thrown a foot into
the air, glad to come down again, bump, bump, on the saddle, by
dint of holding on to the front pommel with the left hand, while
the right was engaged with the bridle, which in the violence of
the exercise it was impossible to change to its proper hand. I
had almost reached the caravan, and had no doubt my hump-backed
Pegasus would relax his exertions, when a camel-driver,
one of the sons of iniquity, seeing me come up at full speed, and
evidently quite run away with, took it into his head to come to
my assistance.</p>

<p>"I saw what he was at, and called out to him to get out of
the way, but instead of this he stuck himself straight before me,
stretching himself out like a St. Andrew's cross, with one hand
armed with a huge club, and making most diabolical grimaces.
Of course the camel was frightened, it was enough to frighten a
much more reasonable being; so, wheeling quickly round, it upset
my unstable equilibrium. Down I came head foremost to the
ground, and when I looked up, my forehead streaming with
blood, the first thing I saw was my Arab with the camel, which
he seemed mightily pleased with himself for having so cleverly
captured, while the servant who had suggested the unlucky experiment
came ambling along on my easy-paced dromedary, and
consoled me by saying that he knew it was a runaway beast,
which there was no riding without a nose-string.</p>

<p>"I now began to study the way of keeping one's seat in such
an emergency. An Arab, when he gallops his dromedary with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
one of these saddles, holds hard on with the right hand to the
back part of the seat, not to the pommel, and grasps the bridle
tightly in the other. The movement of the camel in galloping
throws one violently forward, and without holding on, excepting
on the naked back, when the rider sits behind the hump, it is
impossible to retain one's seat. I afterwards thought myself
lucky in not having studied this point sooner, as, from the greater
resistance I should have offered, my tumble, since it was <em>fated</em> I
should have one, would probably have been much more severe.
It is true I might also have escaped it, but in the chapter of
probabilities I always think a mishap the most probable."</p>

<p>It may be imagined that a fall from a Camel's back is not
a trifle, and, even if the unskilful rider be fortunate enough to
fall on soft sand instead of hard rock, he receives a tolerably
severe shock, and runs no little risk of breaking a limb. For
the average height of a Camel's back is rather more than six feet,
while some animals measure seven feet from the ground to the
top of the hump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>This height, however, is of material advantage to the traveller.
In the first place it lifts him above the waves of heated air that
are continually rolling over the sand on which the burning rays
of the sun are poured throughout the day; and in the second
place it brings him within reach of the slightest breeze that
passes above the stratum of hot air, and which comes to the
traveller like the breath of life. Moreover, his elevated position
enables him to see for a very great distance, which is an
invaluable advantage in a land where every stranger may be
a robber, and is probably a murderer besides.</p>

<p>The best mode of avoiding a fall is to follow the Arab mode
of riding,&mdash;namely, to pass one leg over the upright pommel,
which, as has been mentioned, is a mere wooden peg or stake,
and hitching the other leg over the dangling foot. Perhaps the
safest, though not the most comfortable, mode of sitting is by
crossing the legs in front, and merely grasping the pommel with
the hands.</p>

<p>Yet, fatiguing as is the seat on the Camel's back to the
beginner, it is less so than that on the horse's saddle, inasmuch
as in the latter case one position is preserved, while in the
former an infinite variety of seat is attainable when the rider
has fairly mastered the art of riding.</p>

<p>The Camel is not held by the bit and bridle like the horse,
but by a rope tied like a halter round the muzzle, and having
a knot on the left or "near" side. This is held in the left hand,
and is used chiefly for the purpose of stopping the animal. The
Camel is guided partly by the voice of its rider, and partly by
a driving-stick, with which the neck is lightly touched on the
opposite side to that which its rider wishes it to take. A
pressure of the heel on the shoulder-bone tells it to quicken its
pace, and a little tap on the head followed by a touch on the
short ears are the signals for full speed.</p>

<p>There are three different kinds of stick with which the Camel
is driven; one of them, a mere almond branch with the bark,
and an oblique head, is the sceptre or emblem of sovereignty of
the Prince of Mecca. Mr. Hamilton suggests that this stick,
called the "<em>mesh'ab</em>," is the original of the jackal-headed stick
with which so many of the Egyptian deities are represented;
and that Aaron's rod that "brought forth buds, and bloomed
blossoms, and yielded almonds," was the <em>mesh'ab</em>, the almond-branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
sceptre, the emblem of his almost regal rank and authority.</p>

</div>

<p>The women mostly ride in a different manner from the men.
Sometimes they are hardy enough to sit the animal in the same
way as their husbands, but as a rule they are carried by the
animal rather than ride it, sitting in great basket-like appendages
which are slung on either side of the Camel. These constitute
the "furniture" which is mentioned in Gen. xxxi. 34. When
Jacob left the house of Laban, to lead an independent life,
Rachel stole her father's images, or "teraphim," and carried them
away with her, true to her affectionate though deceptive nature,
which impelled her to incur the guilt of robbery for the sake of
enriching her husband with the cherished teraphim of her
father. From the most careful researches we learn that these
teraphim were used for divining the future, and that they were
made in the human form. That they were of considerable size
is evident from the fact that, when Saul was hunting after David,
his wife Michal contrived to convey him out of the house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for a time to conceal her fraud by putting an image (or teraph)
into the bed as a representative of her husband. Had not,
therefore, the camel-furniture been of considerable dimensions,
images of such a size could not be hidden, but they could
well be stowed away in the great panniers, as long as their
mistress sat upon them, after the custom of Oriental travellers
and declined to rise on the ready plea of indisposition.</p>

</div>

<p>This sort of carriage is still used for the women and children.
"The wife and child came by in the string of camels, the
former reclining in an immense circular box, stuffed and padded,
covered with red cotton, and dressed with yellow worsted ornaments.
This family nest was mounted on a large camel. It
seemed a most commodious and well-arranged travelling carriage,
and very superior as a mode of camel-riding to that which our
Sitteen rejoiced in (<em>i.e.</em> riding upon a saddle). The Arab wife
could change her position at pleasure, and the child had room
to walk about and could not fall out, the sides of the box just
reaching to its shoulders. Various jugs and skins and articles
of domestic use hung suspended about it, and trappings of
fringe and finery ornamented it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>This last sentence brings us to another point which is several
times mentioned in the Bible; namely, the ornaments with
which the proprietors of Camels are fond of bedizening their
favourite animals.</p>

<p>Their leathern collars are covered with cowrie shells sewn on
them in various fantastic patterns. Crescent-shaped ornaments
are made of shells sewn on red cloth, and hung so abundantly
upon the harness of the animal that they jingle at every step
which it takes. Sheiks and other men of rank often have
these ornaments made of silver, so that the cost of the entire
trappings is very great.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE DELOUL, OR SWIFT CAMEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We now come to the Swift Camel, or Deloul.</p>

<p>The limbs of the Deloul are long and wiry, having not an
ounce of superfluous fat upon them, the shoulders are very broad,
and the hump, though firm and hard, is very small.</p>

<p>A thoroughbred Deloul, in good travelling condition, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at all a pleasing animal to an ordinary eye, being a lank, gaunt,
and ungainly-looking creature, the very conformation which
insures its swiftness and endurance being that which detracts
from its beauty. An Arab of the desert, however, thinks a
good Deloul one of the finest sights in the world. As the talk
of the pastoral tribes is of sheep and oxen, so is the talk of the
nomads about Camels. It is a subject which is for ever on their
lips, and a true Bedouin may be seen to contemplate the beauties
of one of these favourite animals for hours at a time,&mdash;if his
own, with the rapture of a possessor, or, if another's, with the
determination of stealing it when he can find an opportunity.</p>

<p>Instead of plodding along at the rate of three miles an hour,
which is the average speed of the common Camel, the Deloul
can cover, if lightly loaded, nine or ten miles an hour, and go on
at the same pace for a wonderful time, its long legs swinging,
and its body swaying, as if it were but an animated machine.
Delouls have been reported to have journeyed for nearly fifty
hours without a single stop for rest, during which time the
animals must have traversed nearly five hundred miles. Such
examples must, however, be exceptional, implying, as they do,
an amount of endurance on the part of the rider equal to that
of the animal; and even a journey of half that distance is
scarcely possible to ordinary men on Delouls.</p>

<p>For the movements of the Deloul are very rough, and the
rider is obliged to prepare himself for a long journey by belting
himself tightly with two leathern bands, one just under the
arms, and the other round the pit of the stomach. Without
these precautions, the rider would be likely to suffer serious
injuries, and, even with them, the exercise is so severe, that an
Arab makes it a matter of special boast that he can ride a
Deloul for a whole day.</p>

<p>A courier belonging to the Sherif of Mecca told Mr. Hamilton
that he often went on the same dromedary from Mecca to Medina
in forty-eight hours, the distance being two hundred and forty
miles. And a thoroughbred Deloul will travel for seven or
eight weeks with only four or five days of rest.</p>

<p>Even at the present time, these Camels are used for the conveyance
of special messages, and in the remarkable Bornu kingdom
a regular service of these animals is established, two couriers
always travelling in company, so that if one rider or Camel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
should fail or be captured by the Arabs, who are always on the
alert for so valuable a prey, the other may post on and carry the
message to its destination.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ANOTHER MODE OF RIDING THE CAMEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The swift dromedary, or Deloul, is mentioned several times in
the Old Testament. One of them occurs in Isa. lx. 6: "The
multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian
and Ephah." In this passage a distinction is drawn between
the ordinary Camel and the swift dromedary, the former being
the word "gamel," and the latter the word "beker," which is
again used in Jer. ii. 23: "See thy way in the valley, know
what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary."</p>

<p>There is a passage in the Book of Esther which looks as if it
referred to the ordinary Camel and the swift dromedary, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
there is considerable uncertainty about the proper rendering
It runs as follows: "And he wrote in king Ahasuerus' name,
and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters and
posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young
dromedaries."</p>

<p>The Jewish Bible, however, translates this passage as follows:
"And sent letters by the runners on the horses, and riders on
the racers, mules, and young mares." Now, the word <em>rekesh</em>,
which is translated as "racer," is rendered by Buxtorf as "a
swift horse or mule," and the word <em>beni-rammachim</em>, which
is translated as "young mares," literally signifies "those born
of mares."</p>

<p>The Camel-drivers behave towards their animals with the
curious inconsistency which forms so large a part of the Oriental
character.</p>

<p>Prizing them above nearly all earthly things, proud of them,
and loving them after their own fashion, the drivers will talk to
them, cheer them, and sing interminable songs for their benefit.
Towards the afternoon the singing generally begins, and it goes
on without cessation in a sort of monotonous hum, as Dr. Bonar
calls it. The same traveller calls attention to a passage in
Caussinus' "Polyhistor Symbolicus," in which the learned and
didactic author symbolizes the maxim that more can be done by
kindness than by blows. "The Camel is greatly taken with
music and melody. So much so, indeed, that if it halts through
weariness, the driver does not urge it with stripes and blows,
but soothes it by his songs."</p>

<p>Several travellers have mentioned these songs. See, for
example, Miss Rogers' account of some Bedouins: "Their songs
were already subdued to harmonize with their monotonous
swinging pace, and chimed softly and plaintively with the
tinkling of camel-bells, thus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes a female Camel gives birth to a colt on the journey.
In such a case, a brief pause is made, and then the train proceeds
on its journey, the owner of the Camel carrying the young
one in his arms until the evening halt. He then gives it to its
mother, and on the following day it is able to follow her without
further assistance. The young Camels are almost pretty, their
hair being paler than that of the adult animal, and their limbs
more slender.</p>

<p>Although the young Camel is better-looking than its parents,
it is not one whit more playful. Unlike almost all other animals,
the Camel seems to have no idea of play, and even the young
Camel of a month or two old follows its mother with the same
steady, regular pace which she herself maintains.</p>

<p>In spite of all the kindness with which a driver treats his
Camels, he can at times be exceedingly cruel to them, persisting
in over-loading and over-driving them, and then, if a Camel fall
exhausted, removing its load, and distributing it among the
other Camels. As soon as this is done, he gives the signal to
proceed, and goes on his way, abandoning the wretched animal
to its fate&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> to thirst and the vultures. He will not even
have the humanity to kill it, but simply leaves it on the ground,
muttering that it is "his fate!"</p>

<p>We now come to the general characteristics of the Camel.</p>

<p>The Camels know their master well, some of them being
much more affectionate than others. But they are liable to fits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of strange fury, in which case even their own masters are not
safe from them. They are also of a revengeful nature, and have
an unpleasant faculty of treasuring up an injury until they can
find a time of repaying it. Signor Pierotti gives a curious
example of this trait of character. As he was going to the
Jordan, he found a dead Camel lying on the roadside, the head
nearly separated from the body. On inquiry he found that
the animal had a master who ill-treated it, and had several times
tried to bite him. One evening, after the Camels had been
unloaded, the drivers lay down to sleep as usual.</p>

<p>The Camel made its way to its master, and stamped on him
as he slept. The man uttered one startled cry, but had no time
for another. The infuriated Camel followed up its attack by
grasping his throat in its powerful jaws, and shaking him to
death. The whole scene passed so rapidly, that before the other
drivers could come to the man's assistance he was hanging dead
from the jaws of the Camel, who was shaking him as a dog
shakes a rat, and would not release its victim until its head
had been nearly severed from its body by sword-cuts.</p>

<p>A similar anecdote is told by Mr. Palgrave, in his "Central
and Eastern Arabia:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"One passion alone he possesses, namely, revenge, of which
he gives many a hideous example; while, in carrying it out, he
shows an unexpected degree of forethoughted malice, united meanwhile
with all the cold stupidity of his usual character. One
instance of this I well remember&mdash;it occurred hard by a small
town in the plain of Baalbec, where I was at the time residing.</p>

<p>"A lad of about fourteen had conducted a large camel, laden
with wood, from that very village to another at half an hour's
distance or so. As the animal loitered or turned out of the way,
its conductor struck it repeatedly, and harder than it seems to
have thought he had a right to do. But, not finding the occasion
favourable for taking immediate quits, it 'bided its time,' nor
was that time long in coming.</p>

<p>"A few days later, the same lad had to re-conduct the beast,
but unladen, to his own village. When they were about half
way on the road, and at some distance from any habitation, the
camel suddenly stopped, looked deliberately round in every
direction to assure itself that no one was in sight, and, finding
the road clear of passers-by, made a step forward, seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
unlucky boy's head in its monstrous mouth, and, lifting him up
in the air, flung him down again on the earth, with the upper
part of his head completely torn off, and his brains scattered on
the ground. Having thus satisfied its revenge, the brute quietly
resumed its pace towards the village, as though nothing were
the matter, till some men, who had observed the whole, though
unfortunately at too great a distance to be able to afford timely
help, came up and killed it.</p>

<p>"Indeed, so marked is this unamiable propensity, that some
philosophers have ascribed the revengeful character of the Arabs
to the great share which the flesh and milk of the camel have
in their sustenance, and which are supposed to communicate, to
those who partake of them over-largely, the moral or immoral
qualities of the animal to which they belonged. I do not feel
myself capable of pronouncing an opinion on so intricate a
question, but thus much I can say, that the camel and its
Bedouin master do afford so many and such divers points of
resemblance, that I do not think our Arab of Shomer far in the
wrong, when I once on a time heard him say, 'God created the
Bedouin for the camel, and the camel for the Bedouin.'"</p>

<p>The reader will observe that Mr. Palgrave in this anecdote
makes reference to the stupidity of the Camel. There is no
doubt that the Camel is by no means an intellectual animal; but
it is very possible that its stupidity may in a great measure be
owing to the fact that no one has tried to cultivate its intellectual
powers. The preceding anecdotes show clearly that the Camel
must possess a strong memory, and be capable of exercising
considerable ingenuity.</p>

<p>Still it is not a clever animal. If its master should fall off
its back, it never dreams of stopping, as a well-trained horse
would do, but proceeds at the same plodding pace, leaving his
master to catch it if he can. Should it turn out of the way to
crop some green thorn-bush, it will go on in the same direction,
never thinking of turning back into the right road unless directed
by its rider. Should the Camel stray, "it is a thousand
to one that he will never find his way back to his accustomed
home or pasture, and the first man who picks him up will have
no particular shyness to get over; ... and the losing of his old
master and of his former cameline companions gives him no
regret, and occasions no endeavour to find them again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>He has the strongest objection to being laden at all, no matter
how light may be the burden, and expresses his disapprobation
by growling and groaning, and attempting to bite. So habitual
is this conduct that if a kneeling Camel be only approached, and
a stone as large as a walnut laid on its back, it begins to remonstrate
in its usual manner, groaning as if it were crushed to the
earth with its load.</p>

<p>The Camel never makes way for any one, its instinct leading
it to plod onward in its direct course. What may have been its
habits in a state of nature no one can tell, for such a phenomenon
as a wild Camel has never been known in the memory of man.
There are wild oxen, wild goats, wild sheep, wild horses, and
wild asses, but there is no spot on the face of the earth where
the Camel is found except as the servant of man. Through
innate stupidity, according to Mr. Palgrave, it goes straight forwards
in the direction to which its head happens to be pointed,
and is too foolish even to think of stopping unless it hears the
signal for halt.</p>

<p>As it passes through the narrow streets of an Oriental city,
laden with goods that project on either side, and nearly fill up
the thoroughfare, it causes singular inconvenience, forcing every
one who is in front of it to press himself closely to the wall, and
to make way for the enormous beast as it plods along. The
driver or rider generally gives notice by continually calling to
the pedestrians to get out of the way, but a laden Camel rarely
passes through a long street without having knocked down a
man or two, or driven before it a few riders on asses who cannot
pass between the Camel and the wall.</p>

<p>One source of danger to its rider is to be found in the low
archways which span so many of the streets. They are just
high enough to permit a laden Camel to pass under them, but are
so low that they leave no room for a rider. The natives, who
are accustomed to this style of architecture, are always ready for
an archway, and, when the rider sees an archway which will not
allow him to retain his seat, he slips to the ground, and remounts
on the other side of the obstacle.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard had a very narrow escape with one of these arch
ways. "I had passed beneath one or two in perfect safety, without
being obliged to do more than just bend my head forward, and
was in the act of conversing with one of my companions behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and was therefore in a happy state of ignorance as to what was
immediately before me, when the shouting and running together
of the people in the street on either side made me turn my head
quickly, but only just in time to feel my breath thrown back on
my face against the keystone of a gateway, beneath which my
camel, with too much way on him to be stopped immediately,
had already commenced to pass.</p>

<p>"With a sort of feeling that it was all over with me, I threw
myself back as far as I could, and was carried through in an
almost breathless state, my shirt-studs actually scraping along
against the stonework. On emerging again into the open
street, I could hardly realize my escape, for if there had been a
single projecting stone to stop my progress, the camel would
have struggled to get free, and my chest must have been
crushed in."</p>

<p>It will be seen from these instances that the charge of stupidity
is not an undeserved one. Still the animal has enough
intellect to receive all the education which it needs for the service
of man, and which it receives at a very early age. The ordinary
Camel of burden is merely taught to follow its conductor, to
obey the various words and gestures of command, and to endure
a load. The Deloul, however, is more carefully trained. It is
allowed to follow its mother for a whole year in perfect liberty.
Towards the expiration of that time the young animal is gradually
stinted in its supply of milk, and forced to browse for its nourishment.
On the anniversary of its birth, the young Deloul is
turned with its head towards Canopus, and its ears solemnly
boxed, its master saying at the same time, "Henceforth drinkest
thou no drop of milk." For this reason the newly-weaned
Camel is called Lathim, or the "ear-boxed." It is then prevented
from sucking by a simple though cruel experiment. A
wooden peg is sharpened at both ends, and one end thrust into
the young animal's nose. When it tries to suck, it pricks its
mother with the projecting end, and at the same time forces the
other end more deeply into the wound, so that the mother drives
away her offspring, and the young soon ceases to make the
attempt.</p>

<p>The food of the Camel is very simple, being, in fact, anything
that it can get. As it proceeds on its journey, it manages to
browse as it goes along, bending its long neck to the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a><br /><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
cropping the scanty herbage without a pause. Camels have
been known to travel for twenty successive days, passing over
some eight hundred miles of ground, without receiving any food
except that which they gathered for themselves by the way.
The favourite food of the Camel is a shrub called the ghada,
growing to six feet or so in height, and forming a feathery tuft
of innumerable little green twigs, very slender and flexible. It
is so fond of this shrub that a Camel can scarcely ever pass a
bush without turning aside to crop it; and even though it be
beaten severely for its misconduct, it will repeat the process at
the next shrub that comes in sight.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PASSING A CAMEL IN A NARROW STREET OF AN EASTERN CITY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It also feeds abundantly on the thorn-bushes which grow so
plentifully in that part of the world; and though the thorns are
an inch or two in length, very strong, and as sharp as needles,
the hard, horny palate of the animal enables it to devour them
with perfect ease.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="bush" id="bush"></a>
<img src="images/i_277.jpg" width="400" height="335" alt="bush" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MOSES AT THE BURNING BUSH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are several species of these thorn-shrubs, which are
scattered profusely over the ground, and are, in fact, the commonest
growth of the place. After they die, being under the
fierce sun of that climate, they dry up so completely, that if
a light be set to them they blaze up in a moment, with a sharp
cracking sound and a roar of flame, and in a moment or two are
nothing but a heap of light ashes. No wonder was it that when
Moses saw the thorn-bush burning without being consumed he
was struck with awe at the miracle. These withered bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
are the common fuel of the desert, giving out a fierce but brief
heat, and then suddenly sinking into ashes. "For as the
crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool"
(Eccl. vii. 6).</p>

<p>The dried and withered twigs of these bushes are also eaten
by the Camel, which seems to have a power of extracting nutriment
from every sort of vegetable substance. It has been fed
on charcoal, and, as has been happily remarked, could thrive on
the shavings of a carpenter's workshop.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="encampment" id="encampment"></a>
<img src="images/i_278.jpg" width="450" height="406" alt="encampment" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN ARAB ENCAMPMENT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Still, when food is plentiful, it is fed as regularly as can be
managed, and generally after a rather peculiar manner. "Our
guide," writes Mr. Hamilton, in the work which has already been
mentioned, "is an elderly man, the least uncouth of our camel-drivers.
He has three camels in the caravan, and it was amusing
to see his preparations for their evening's entertainment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
table-cloth, a circular piece of leather, was duly spread on the
ground; on this he poured the quantity of dourrah destined for
their meal, and calling his camels, they came and took each its
place at the feast. It is quaint to see how each in his turn eats,
so gravely and so quietly, stretching his long neck into the
middle of the heap, then raising his head to masticate each
mouthful; all so slowly and with such gusto, that we could
swear it was a party of epicures sitting in judgment on one of
Vachette's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>."</p>

<p>The foregoing passages will show the reader how wonderfully
adapted is the constitution of the Camel for the country in which
it lives, and how indispensable it is to the inhabitants. It has
been called "the ship of the desert," for without the Camel the
desert would be as impassable as the sea without ships. No
water being found for several days' journey together, the animal
is able to carry within itself a supply of water which will last it
for several days, and, as no green thing grows far from the
presence of water, the Camel is able to feed upon the brief-lived
thorn-shrubs which have sprung up and died, and which, from
their hard and sharp prickles, are safe from every animal except
the hard-mouthed Camel.</p>

<p>But these advantages would be useless without another&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>
the foot. The mixed stones and sand of the desert would ruin
the feet of almost any animal, and it is necessary that the Camel
should be furnished with a foot that cannot be split by heat like
the hoof of a horse, that is broad enough to prevent the creature
from sinking into the sand, and is tough enough to withstand
the action of the rough and burning soil.</p>

<p>Such a foot does the Camel possess. It consists of two long
toes resting upon a hard elastic cushion with a tough and horny
sole. This cushion is so soft that the tread of the huge animal
is as noiseless as that of a cat, and, owing to the division of the
toes, it spreads as the weight comes upon it, and thus gives
a firm footing on loose ground. The foot of the moose-deer has
a similar property, in order to enable the animal to walk upon
the snow.</p>

<p>In consequence of this structure, the Camel sinks less deeply
into the ground than any other animal; but yet it does sink in
it, and dislikes a deep and loose sand, groaning at every step,
and being wearied by the exertion of dragging its hard foot out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of the holes into which they sink. It is popularly thought that
hills are impracticable to the Camel; but it is able to climb even
rocky ground from which a horse would recoil. Mr. Marsh, an
American traveller, was much surprised by seeing a caravan of
fifty camels pass over a long ascent in Arabia Petræa. The rock
was as smooth as polished marble, and the angle was on an
average fifteen degrees; but the whole caravan passed over it
without an accident.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="marches" id="marches"></a>
<img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="400" height="464" alt="march" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ON THE MARCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The soil that a Camel most hates is a wet and muddy ground,
on which it is nearly sure to slip. If the reader will look at a
Camel from behind, he will see that the hinder legs are close
together until the ankle-joint, when they separate so widely that
the feet are set on the ground at a considerable distance from each
other. On dry ground this structure increases the stability of
the animal by increasing its base; but on wet ground the effect
is singularly unpleasant. The soft, padded feet have no hold,
and slip sideways at every step, often with such violence as to
dislocate a joint and cause the death of the animal. When
such ground has to be traversed, the driver generally passes a
bandage round the hind legs just below the ankle-joint, so as to
prevent them from diverging too far.</p>

<p>It must be remarked, however, that the country in which the
animal lives is essentially a dry one, and that moist and muddy
ground is so exceptional that the generality of Camels never see
it in their lives. Camels do not object to mud an inch or two
deep, provided that there is firm ground below; and they have
been seen to walk with confident safety over pavements covered
with mud and half-frozen snow.</p>

<p>The animals can ford rivers well enough, provided that the
bed be stony or gravelly; but they are bad swimmers, their
round bodies and long necks being scarcely balanced by their
legs, so that they are apt to roll over on their sides, and in such
a case they are sure to be drowned. When swimming is a
necessity, the head is generally tied to the stern of a boat, or
guided by the driver swimming in front, while another often
clings to the tail, so as to depress the rump and elevate the
head. It is rather curious that the Camels of the Sahara cannot
be safely entrusted to the water. They will swim the river
readily enough; but they are apt to be seized with illness afterwards,
and to die in a few hours.</p>

<p>We now come to some other uses of the Camel.</p>

<p>Its hair is of the greatest importance, as it is used for many
purposes. In this country, all that we know practically of the
Camel's hair is that it is employed in making brushes for
painters; but in its own land the hair plays a really important
part. At the proper season it is removed from the animal,
usually by being pulled away in tufts, but sometimes by being
shorn, and it is then spun by the women into strong thread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>From this thread are made sundry fabrics where strength is
required and coarseness is not an objection. The "black tents"
of the Bedouin Arabs, similar to those in which Abraham lived,
are made of Camel's hair, and so are the rugs, carpets, and cordage
used by the nomad tribes. Even mantles for rainy or cold
weather are made of Camel's hair, and it was in a dress of this
coarse and rough material that St. John the Baptist was clad.
The best part of the Camels hair is that which grows in tufts
on the back and about the hump, the fibre being much longer
than that which covers the body. There is also a little very
fine under-wool which is carefully gathered, and, when a sufficient
quantity is procured, it is spun and woven into garments.
Shawls of this material are even now as valuable as those which
are made from the Cachmire goat.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="hair" id="hair"></a>
<img src="images/i_282.jpg" width="300" height="233" alt="hair" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HAIR OF THE CAMEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The skin of the Camel is made into a sort of leather. It is
simply tanned by being pegged out in the sun and rubbed with
salt.</p>

<p>Sandals and leggings are made of this leather, and in some
places water-bottles are manufactured from it, the leather being
thicker and less porous than that of the goat, and therefore
wasting less of the water by evaporation. The bones are utilized,
being made into various articles of commerce.</p>

<p>So universally valuable is the Camel that even its dung is
important to its owners. Owing to the substances on which the
animal feeds, it consists of little but macerated fragments of aromatic
shrubs. It is much used as poultices in case of bruises
or rheumatic pains, and is even applied with some success to
simple fractures. It is largely employed for fuel, and the desert
couriers use nothing else, their Camels being furnished with a
net, so that none of this useful substance shall be lost. For this
purpose it is carefully collected, mixed with bits of straw, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
made into little rolls, which are dried in the sun, and can then
be laid by for any time until they are needed.</p>

<p>Mixed with clay and straw, it is most valuable as a kind of
mortar or cement with which the walls of huts are rendered
weather-proof, and the same material is used in the better-class
houses to make a sort of terrace on the flat roof. This must be
waterproof in order to withstand the wet of the rainy season,
and no material answers the purpose so well as that which has
been mentioned. So strangely hard and firm is this composition,
that stoves are made of it. These stoves are made like jars, and
have the faculty of resisting the power of the inclosed fire. Even
after it is burned it has its uses, the ashes being employed in the
manufacture of sal-ammoniac.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are two passages in the New Testament which mention
the Camel in an allegorical sense. The first of these is the
proverbial saying of our Lord, "A rich man shall hardly enter
into the kingdom of heaven. Again I say unto you, It is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of God" (Matt. xix. 23, 24).</p>

<p>Now, this well-known but scarcely understood passage requires
some little dissection. If the reader will refer to the
context, he will see that this saying was spoken in allusion to
the young and wealthy man who desired to be one of the
disciples, but clung too tightly to his wealth to accept the only
conditions on which he could be received. His possessions were
a snare to him, as was proved by his refusal to part with them
at Christ's command. On his retiring, the expression was used,
"that a rich man shall hardly (or, with difficulty) enter the
kingdom of heaven;" followed by the simile of the Camel and
the needle's eye.</p>

<p>Now, if we are to take this passage literally, we can but draw
one conclusion from it, that a rich man can no more enter
heaven than a camel pass through the eye of a needle, i.e. that
it is impossible for him to do so. Whereas, in the previous
sentence, Christ says not that it is impossible, but difficult
(δυσκόλως) for him to do so. It is difficult for a man to use his
money for the service of God, the only purpose for which it was
given him, and the difficulty increases in proportion to its
amount. But wealth in itself is no more a bar to heaven than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
intellect, health, strength, or any other gift, and, if it be rightly
used, is one of the most powerful tools that can be used in the
service of God. Our Lord did not condemn all wealthy men
alike. He knew many; but there was only one whom He
advised to sell his possessions and give them to the poor as the
condition of being admitted among the disciples.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CAMEL GOING THROUGH A "NEEDLE'S EYE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We will now turn to the metaphor of the Camel and the
needle's eye. Of course it can be taken merely as a very bold
metaphor, but it may also be understood in a simpler sense, the
sense in which it was probably understood by those who heard
it. In Oriental cities, there are in the large gates small and
very low apertures called metaphorically "needle's-eyes," just
as we talk of certain windows as "bull's-eyes." These entrances
are too narrow for a Camel to pass through them in the ordinary
manner, especially if loaded. When a laden Camel has to pass
through one of these entrances, it kneels down, its load is
removed, and then it shuffles through on its knees. "Yesterday,"
writes Lady Duff-Gordon from Cairo, "I saw a camel go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the eye of a needle, <em>i.e.</em> the low-arched door of an enclosure. He
must kneel, and bow his head to creep through; and thus the
rich man must humble himself."</p>

<p>There is another passage in which the Camel is used by our
Lord in a metaphorical sense. This is the well-known sentence:
"Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel"
(Matt. xxiii. 24). It is remarkable that an accidental misprint
has robbed this passage of its true force. The real translation
is: "which strain <em>out</em> the gnat, and swallow the camel." The
Greek word is διυλίζω, which signifies to filter thoroughly; and
the allusion is made to the pharisaical custom of filtering liquids
before drinking them, lest by chance a gnat or some such insect
which was forbidden as food might be accidentally swallowed.</p>

<h2>THE BACTRIAN CAMEL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">General description of the animal&mdash;Its use in mountain roads&mdash;Peculiar formation
of the foot&mdash;Uses of a mixed breed&mdash;Its power of enduring cold&mdash;Used chiefly
as a beast of draught&mdash;Unfitness for the plough&mdash;The cart and mode of harnessing&mdash;The
load which it can draw&mdash;Camel-skin ropes&mdash;A Rabbinical legend.</p></blockquote>


<p>The second kind of Camel&mdash;namely, the Bactrian species&mdash;was
probably unknown to the Jews until a comparatively late portion
of their history. This species was employed by the Assyrians,
as we find by the sculptures upon the ruins, and if in no other
way the Jews would become acquainted with them through the
nation by whom they were conquered, and in whose land they
abode for so long.</p>

<p>The Bactrian Camel is at once to be distinguished from that
which has already been described by the two humps and the
clumsier and sturdier form. Still the skeletons of the Bactrian
and Arabian species are so similar that none but a very skilful
anatomist can distinguish between them, and several learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a><br /><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
zoologists have expressed an opinion, in which I entirely coincide,
that the Bactrian and Arabian Camels are but simple
varieties of one and the same species, not nearly so dissimilar
as the greyhound and the bulldog.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="rest" id="rest"></a>
<img src="images/i_286.jpg" width="600" height="332" alt="rest" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A REST IN THE DESERT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Unlike the one-humped Camel, the Bactrian species is quite at
home in a cold climate, and walks over ice as easily as its congener
does over smooth stone. It is an admirable rock-climber,
and is said even to surpass the mule in the sureness of its tread.
This quality is probably occasioned by the peculiar structure of
the foot, which has an elongated toe projecting beyond the soft
pad, and forming a sort of claw. In the winter time the riders
much prefer them to horses, because their long legs enable them
to walk easily through snow, in which a horse could only plunge
helplessly, and would in all probability sink and perish.</p>

<p>A mixed breed of the one-humped and the Bactrian animals is
thought to be the best for hill work in winter time, and General
Harlan actually took two thousand of these animals in winter
time for a distance of three hundred and sixty miles over the
snowy tops of the Indian Caucasus; and though the campaign
lasted for seven months, he only lost one Camel, and that
was accidentally killed. Owing to its use among the hills, the
Bactrian species is sometimes called the Mountain Camel.</p>

<p>It very much dislikes the commencement of spring, because
the warm mid-day sun slightly melts the surface of the snow,
and the frost of night converts it into a thin plate of ice. When
the Camel walks upon this semi-frozen snow, its feet plunge
into the soft substratum through the icy crust, against which its
legs are severely cut. The beginning of the winter is liable to
the same objection.</p>

<p>The mixed breed which has just been mentioned must be
procured from a male Bactrian and a female Arabian Camel. If
the parentage be reversed, the offspring is useless, being weak,
ill-tempered, and disobedient.</p>

<p>The Bactrian Camel is, as has been mentioned, tolerant of
cold, and is indeed so hardy an animal that it bears the severest
winters without seeming to suffer distress, and has been seen
quietly feeding when the thermometer has reached a temperature
several degrees below zero. Sometimes, when the cold is
more than usually sharp, the owners sew a thick cloth round its
body, but even in such extreme cases the animal is left to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
its own food as it best can. And, however severe the weather
may be, the Bactrian Camel never sleeps under a roof.</p>

<p>This Camel is sometimes employed as a beast of burden, but
its general use is for draught. It is not often used alone for the
plough, because it has an uncertain and jerking mode of pulling,
and does not possess the steady dragging movement which is
obtained by the use of the horse or ox.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="bactrian" id="bactrian"></a>
<img src="images/i_288.jpg" width="400" height="403" alt="bactrian" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BACTRIAN CAMELS DRAWING CART.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is almost invariably harnessed to carts, and always in pairs.
The mode of yoking the animals is as simple as can well be
conceived. A pole runs between them from the front of the
vehicle, and the Camels are attached to it by means of a pole
which passes over their necks. Oxen were harnessed in a
similar manner. It was probably one of these cars or chariots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
that was mentioned by Isaiah in his prophecy respecting
Assyria:&mdash;"And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a
chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels" (Isa. xxi. 7). The cars
themselves are as simple as the mode of harnessing them, being
almost exactly like the ox carts which have already been
described.</p>

<p>The weight which can be drawn by a pair of these Camels is
really considerable. On a tolerably made road a good pair of
Camels are expected to draw from twenty-six to twenty-eight
hundred weight, and to continue their labours for twenty or
thirty successive days, traversing each day an average of thirty
miles. It is much slower than the Arabian Camel, seldom going
at more than two and a half miles per hour. If, however, the
vehicle to which a pair of Bactrians are harnessed were well
made, the wheels truly circular, and the axles kept greased so as
to diminish the friction, there is no doubt that the animals could
draw a still greater load to longer distances, and with less
trouble to themselves. As it is, the wheels are wretchedly
fitted, and their ungreased axles keep up a continual creaking
that is most painful to an unaccustomed ear, and totally unheeded
by the drivers.</p>

<p>The hair of the Bactrian Camel is long, coarse, and strong;
and, like that of the Arabian animal, is made into rough cloth.
It is plucked off by hand in the summer time, when it naturally
becomes loose in readiness for its annual renewal, and the weight
of the entire crop of hair ought to be about ten pounds. The
skin is not much valued, and is seldom used for any purpose
except for making ropes, straps, and thongs, and is not thought
worth the trouble of tanning. The milk, like that of the
Arabian animal, is much used for food, but the quantity is very
trifling, barely two quarts per diem being procured from each
Camel.</p>

<p>There is but little that is generally interesting in the Rabbinical
writers on the Camel. They have one proverbial saying
upon the shortness of its ears. When any one makes a request
that is likely to be refused, they quote the instance of the
Camel, who, it seems, was dissatisfied with its appearance, and
asked for horns to match its long ears. The result of the request
was, that it was deprived of its ears, and got no horns.</p>

<h2>THE HORSE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Hebrew words which signify the Horse&mdash;The Horse introduced into Palestine
from Egypt&mdash;Similarity of the war-horse of Scripture and the Arab horse of
the present day&mdash;Characteristics of the Horse&mdash;Courage and endurance of the
Horse&mdash;Hardness of its unshod hoofs&mdash;Love of the Arab for his Horse&mdash;Difficulty
of purchasing the animal&mdash;The Horse prohibited to the Israelites&mdash;Solomon's
disregard of the edict&mdash;The war-chariot, its form and use&mdash;Probable
construction of the iron chariot&mdash;The cavalry Horse&mdash;Lack of personal interest
in the animal.</p></blockquote>


<p>Several Hebrew words are used by the various Scriptural
writers to signify the Horse, and, like our own terms of horse,
mare, pony, charger, &amp;c., are used to express the different qualities
of the animal. The chief distinction of the Horse seemed
to lie in its use for riding or driving, the larger and heavier
animals being naturally required for drawing the weighty springless
chariots. The chariot horse was represented by the word
<em>Sus</em>, and the cavalry horse by the word <em>Parash</em>, and in several
passages both these words occur in bold contrast to each other.
See, for example, 1 Kings iv. 26, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the many passages of Scripture in which the Horse is
mentioned, there are few which do not treat of it as an adjunct
of war, and therefore it is chiefly in that light that we must
regard it.</p>

<p>The Horse of the Scriptures was evidently a similar animal
to the Arab Horse of the present day, as we find not only from
internal evidence, but from the sculptures and paintings which
still remain to tell us of the vanished glories of Egypt and
Assyria. It is remarkable, by the way, that the first mention of
the Horse in the Scriptures alludes to it as an Egyptian animal.
During the terrible famine which Joseph had foretold, the
Egyptians and the inhabitants of neighbouring countries were
unable to find food for themselves or fodder for their cattle, and,
accordingly, they sold all their beasts for bread. "And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
brought their cattle unto Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread
in exchange for horses and the flocks, and for the cattle of herds,
and for the asses, and he fed them with bread for all their cattle
for that year."</p>

<p>This particular breed of Horses is peculiarly fitted for the
purposes of war, and is much less apt for peaceful duties than
the heavier and more powerful breeds, which are found in different
parts of the world. It is remarkable for the flexible
agility of its movements, which enable it to adapt itself to
every movement of the rider, whose intentions it seems to divine
by a sort of instinct, and who guides it not so much by the
bridle as by the pressure of the knees and the voice. Examples
of a similar mode of guidance may be seen on the well-known
frieze of the Parthenon, where, in the Procession of Horsemen,
the riders may be seen directing their steeds by touching the
side of the neck with one finger, thus showing their own skill
and the well-trained quality of the animals which they ride.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TRIAL OF ARAB HORSES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Its endurance is really wonderful, and a horse of the Kochlani
breed will go through an amount of work which is almost
incredible. Even the trial by which a Horse is tested is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a><br /><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
severe, that any other animal would be either killed on the spot
or ruined for life. When a young mare is tried for the first
time, her owner rides her for some fifty or sixty miles at full
speed, always finishing by swimming her through a river. After
this trial she is expected to feed freely; and should she refuse
her food, she is rejected as an animal unworthy of the name of
Kochlani.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN ARAB HORSE OF THE KOCHLANI BREED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Partly from native qualities, and partly from constant association
with mankind, the Arab Horse is a singularly intelligent
animal. In Europe we scarcely give the Horse credit for the
sensitive intelligence with which it is endowed, and look upon
it rather as a machine for draught and carriage than a companion
to man. The Arab, however, lives with his horse, and
finds in it the docility and intelligence which we are accustomed
to associate with the dog rather than the Horse. It
will follow him about and come at his call. It will stand
for any length of time and await its rider without moving.
Should he fall from its back, it will stop and stand patiently
by him until he can remount; and there is a well-authenticated
instance of an Arab Horse whose master had been wounded in
battle, taking him up by his clothes and carrying him away to a
place of safety.</p>

<p>Even in the very heat and turmoil of the combat, the true
Arab Horse seems to be in his true element, and fully deserves
the splendid eulogium in the Book of Job (xxxix. 19-25):
"Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his
neck with thunder?</p>

<p>"Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory
of his nostrils is terror.</p>

<p>"He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he
goeth on to meet the armed men.</p>

<p>"He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth
he back from the sword.</p>

<p>"The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
shield.</p>

<p>"He walketh the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p>

<p>"He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."</p>

<p>In another passage an allusion is made to the courage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Horse, and its love for the battle. "I hearkened and heard, but
they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness,
saying, What have I done? Every one turned to his course, as
the horse rusheth into the battle." (Jer. viii. 6.) Even in the
mimic battle of the djereed the Horse seems to exult in the conflict
as much as his rider, and wheels or halts almost without
the slightest intimation.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="war" id="war"></a>
<img src="images/i_294.jpg" width="400" height="381" alt="war" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WAR HORSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The hoofs of the Arab Horses are never shod, their owners
thinking that that act is not likely to improve nature, and even
among the burning sands and hard rocks the Horse treads with
unbroken hoof. In such a climate, indeed, an iron shoe would
be worse than useless, as it would only scorch the hoof by day,
and in consequence of the rapid change of temperature by day or
night, the continual expansion and contraction of the metal would
soon work the nails loose, and cause the shoe to fall off.</p>

<p>A tender-footed Horse would be of little value, and so we
often find in the Scriptures that the hardness of the hoof is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
reckoned among one of the best qualities of a Horse. See, for
example, Isa. v. 28: "Whose arrows are sharp, and all their
bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and
their wheels like a whirlwind." Again, in Micah iv. 13: "Arise
and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn
iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in
pieces many people." Allusion is here made to one mode of
threshing, in which a number of Horses were turned into the
threshing-floor, and driven about at random among the wheat,
instead of walking steadily like the oxen.</p>

<p>In Judges v. 22 there is a curious allusion to the hoofs of
the Horse. It occurs in the Psalm of Thanksgiving sung by
Deborah and Barak after the death of Sisera: "Then were the
horse-hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings
of their mighty ones."</p>

<p>Horses possessed of the qualities of courage, endurance, and
sureness of foot are naturally invaluable; and even at the
present day the Arab warrior esteems above all things a Horse
of the purest breed, and, whether he buys or sells one, takes care
to have its genealogy made out and hung on the animal's neck.</p>

<p>As to the mare, scarcely any inducement is strong enough to
make an Arab part with it, even to a countryman, and the sale
of the animal is hindered by a number of impediments which
in point of fact are almost prohibitory. Signor Pierotti, whose
long residence in Palestine has given him a deep insight into
the character of the people, speaks in the most glowing terms
of the pure Arab Horse, and of its inestimable value to its
owner. Of the difficulties with which the sale of the animal is
surrounded, he gives a very amusing account:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After this enumeration of the merits of the horse, I will
describe the manner in which a sale is conducted, choosing the
case of the mare, as that is the more valuable animal. The price
varies with the purity of blood of the steed, and the fortunes of
its owner. When he is requested to fix a value, his first reply is,
'It is yours, and belongs to you, I am your servant;' because,
perhaps, he does not think that the question is asked with
any real design of purchasing; when the demand is repeated, he
either makes no answer or puts the question by; at the third
demand he generally responds rudely with a sardonic smile,
which is not a pleasant thing to see, as it is a sign of anger; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a><br /><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
then says that he would sooner sell his family than his mare.
This remark is not meant as a mere jest; for it is no uncommon
thing for a Bedawy to give his parents as hostages rather than
separate himself from his friend.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 333px;"><a name="horses" id="horses"></a>
<img src="images/i_296.jpg" width="333" height="600" alt="horses" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ARAB HORSES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"If, however, owing to some misfortune, he determines on
selling his mare, it is very doubtful whether he or his parents
will allow her to leave their country without taking the precaution
to render her unfit for breeding.</p>

<p>"There are many methods of arranging the sale, all of which
I should like to describe particularly; however, I will confine
myself to a general statement. Before the purchaser enters upon
the question of the price to be paid, he must ascertain that the
parents, friends, and allies of the owners give their consent to
the sale, without which some difficulty or other may arise, or
perhaps the mare may be stolen from her new master. He must
also obtain an unquestionable warranty that she is fit for breeding
purposes, and that no other has a prior claim to any part of
her body. This last precaution may seem rather strange, but it
arises from the following custom. It sometimes happens that,
when a Bedawy is greatly in want of money, he raises it most
easily by selling a member of his horse; so that very frequently
a horse belongs to a number of owners, one of whom has purchased
the right fore-leg, another the left, another the hind-leg,
or the tail, or an ear, or the like; and the proprietors have each a
proportionate interest in the profits of its labour or sale.</p>

<p>"So also the offspring are sold in a similar manner; sometimes
only the first-born, sometimes the first three; and then it
occasionally happens that two or three members of the foal are,
as it were, mortgaged. Consequently, any one who is ignorant
of this custom may find that, after he has paid the price of the
mare to her supposed owner, a third person arises who demands
to be paid the value of his part; and, if the purchaser refuse to
comply, he may find himself in a very unpleasant situation,
without any possibility of obtaining help from the local government.
Whoever sells his mare entirely, without reserving to
himself one or two parts, must be on good terms with the confederate
chiefs in the neighbourhood, and must have obtained their
formal sanction, otherwise they would universally despise him,
and perhaps lie in wait to kill him, so that his only hope of
escape would be a disgraceful flight, just as if he had committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a><br /><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
some great crime. It is an easier matter to purchase a stallion;
but even in this case the above formalities must be observed.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 336px;"><a name="buying" id="buying"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BUYING AN ARAB HORSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"These remarks only apply to buying horses of the purest
blood; those of inferior race are obtained without difficulty, and
at fair prices."</p>

<p>For some reason, perhaps the total severance of the Israelites
from the people among whom they had lived so long in captivity,
the use of the Horse, or, at all events, the breeding of it,
was forbidden to the Israelites; see Deut. xvi. 16. After
prophesying that the Israelites, when they had settled themselves
in the Promised Land, would want a king, the inspired
writer next ordains that the new king must be chosen by
Divine command, and must belong to one of the twelve tribes.
He then proceeds as follows:&mdash;"But he shall not multiply
horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to
the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the Lord
hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that
way."</p>

<p>The foresight of this prophetical writer was afterwards shown
by the fact that many kings of Israel did send to Egypt for
Horses, Egypt being the chief source from which these animals
were obtained. And, judging from the monuments to which
reference has been made, the Horse of Egypt was precisely the
same animal as the Arab Horse of the present day, and was
probably obtained from nomad breeders.</p>

<p>In spite of the prohibitory edict, both David and Solomon
used Horses in battle, and the latter supplied himself largely
from Egypt, disregarding as utterly the interdict against plurality
of Horses as that against plurality of wives, which
immediately follows.</p>

<p>David seems to have been the first king who established a
force of chariots, and this he evidently did for the purpose of
action on the flat grounds of Palestine, where infantry were at a
great disadvantage when attacked by the dreaded chariots; yet
he did not controvert the law by multiplying to himself Horses,
or even by importing them from Egypt; and when he had an
opportunity of adding to his army an enormous force of chariots,
he only employed as many as he thought were sufficient for his
purpose. After he defeated Hadadezer, and had taken from
him a thousand chariots with their Horses together with seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a><br /><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
hundred cavalry, he houghed all the Horses except those which
were needed for one hundred chariots.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ARAB'S FAVOURITE STEEDS.</p></div>

<p>Solomon, however, was more lax, and systematically broke
the ancient law by multiplying Horses exceedingly, and sending
to Egypt for them. We learn from 1 Kings iv. 26 of the enormous
establishment which he kept up both for chariots and
cavalry. Besides those which were given to him as tribute, he
purchased both chariots and their Horses from Egypt and Syria.</p>

<p>Chariots were far more valued in battle than horsemen, probably
because their weight made their onset irresistible against
infantry, who had no better weapons than bows and spears.
The slingers themselves could make little impression on the
chariots; and even if the driver, or the warrior who fought in
the chariot, or his attendant, happened to be killed, the weighty
machine, with its two Horses, still went on its destructive way.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PHARAOH PURSUES THE ISRAELITES WITH CHARIOTS AND HORSES, AND THE SEA COVERS
THEM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of their use in battle we find very early mention. For
example, in Exod. xiv. 6 it is mentioned that Pharaoh made ready
his chariot to pursue the Israelites; and in a subsequent part
of the same chapter we find that six hundred of the Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
chariot force accompanied their master in the pursuit, and that
the whole army was delayed because the loss of the chariot
wheels made them drive heavily.</p>

<p>Then in the familiar story of Sisera and Jael the vanquished
general is mentioned as alighting from his chariot, in which he
would be conspicuous, and taking flight on foot; and, after his
death, his mother is represented as awaiting his arrival, and
saying to the women of the household, "Why is his chariot so
long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariot?"</p>

<p>During the war of conquest which Joshua led, the chariot
plays a somewhat important part. As long as the war was
carried on in the rugged mountainous parts of the land, no mention
of the chariot is made; but when the battles had to be
fought on level ground, the enemy brought the dreaded chariots
to bear upon the Israelites. In spite of these adjuncts, Joshua
won the battles, and, unlike David, destroyed the whole of the
Horses and burned the chariots.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, a still more dreadful weapon, the iron
chariot, was used against the Israelites by Jabin. This new
instrument of war seems to have cowed the people completely;
for we find that by means of his nine hundred chariots of iron
Jabin "mightily oppressed the children of Israel" for twenty
years. It has been well suggested that the possession of the
war chariot gave rise to the saying of Benhadad's councillors,
that the gods of Israel were gods of the hills, and so their army
had been defeated; but that if the battle were fought in the
plain, where the chariots and Horses could act, they would be
victorious.</p>

<p>So dreaded were these weapons, even by those who were
familiar with them and were accustomed to use them, that when
the Syrians had besieged Samaria, and had nearly reduced it by
starvation, the fancied sound of a host of chariots and Horses
that they heard in the night caused them all to flee and evacuate
the camp, leaving their booty and all their property in the hands
of the Israelites.</p>

<p>Whether the Jews ever employed the terrible scythe chariots
is not quite certain, though it is probable that they may have
done so; and this conjecture is strengthened by the fact that
they were employed against the Jews by Antiochus, who had
"footmen an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
thousand and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and
three hundred chariots armed with hooks" (2 Macc. xiii. 2).
Some commentators think that by the iron chariots mentioned
above were signified ordinary chariots armed with iron scythes
projecting from the sides.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ELIJAH IS CARRIED UP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By degrees the chariot came to be one of the recognised forces
in war, and we find it mentioned throughout the books of the
Scriptures, not only in its literal sense, but as a metaphor which
every one could understand. In the Psalms, for example, are
several allusions to the war-chariot." He maketh wars to cease
unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the
spear in sunder; He burneth the chariot in the fire" (Ps. xlvi. 9).
Again: "At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and
horse are cast into a dead sleep" (Ps. lxxvi. 6). And: "Some
trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
name of the Lord our God" (Ps. xx. 7). Now, the force of these
passages cannot be properly appreciated unless we realize to
ourselves the dread in which the war-chariot was held by the
foot-soldiers. Even cavalry were much feared; but the chariots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
were objects of almost superstitious fear, and the rushing sound
of their wheels, the noise of the Horses' hoofs, and the shaking
of the ground as the "prancing horses and jumping chariots"
(Nah. iii. 2) thundered along, are repeatedly mentioned.</p>

<p>See, for example, Ezek. xxvi. 10: "By reason of the abundance
of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake
at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the
chariots." Also, Jer. xlvii. 3: "At the noise of the stamping of
the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots,
and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look
back to their children for feebleness of hands." See also Joel
ii. 4, 5: "The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses;
and as horsemen, so shall they run.</p>

<p>"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall
they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the
stubble, as a strong people set in battle array."</p>

<p>In several passages the chariot and Horse are used in bold
imagery as expressions of Divine power: "The chariots of God
are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is
among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place" (Ps. lxviii. 17). A
similar image is employed in Ps. civ. 3: "Who maketh the
clouds His chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind."
In connexion with these passages, we cannot but call to mind
that wonderful day when the unseen power of the Almighty
was made manifest to the servant of Elisha, whose eyes were
suddenly opened, and he saw that the mountain was full of
Horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</p>

<p>The chariot and horses of fire by which Elijah was taken from
earth are also familiar to us, and in connexion with the passage
which describes that wonderful event, we may mention one
which occurs in the splendid prayer of Habakkuk (iii. 8): "Was
the Lord displeased against the rivers? was Thine anger against
the rivers? was Thy wrath against the sea, that Thou didst ride
upon Thine horses and Thy chariots of salvation?"</p>

<p>By degrees the chariot came to be used for peaceful purposes,
and was employed as our carriages of the present day, in carrying
persons of wealth. That this was the case in Egypt from
very early times is evident from Gen. xli. 43, in which we are
told that after Pharaoh had taken Joseph out of prison and
raised him to be next in rank to himself, the king caused him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
ride in the second chariot which he had, and so to be proclaimed
ruler over Egypt. Many years afterwards we find him
travelling in his chariot to the land of Goshen, whither he
went to meet Jacob and to conduct him to the presence of
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>At first the chariot seems to have been too valuable to the
Israelites to have been used for any purpose except war, and it is
not until a comparatively late time that we find it employed as
a carriage, and even then it is only used by the noble and
wealthy. Absalom had such chariots, but it is evident that he
used them for purposes of state, and as appendages of his regal
rank. Chariots or carriages were, however, afterwards employed
by the Israelites as freely as by the Egyptians, from whom they
were originally procured; and accordingly we find Rehoboam
mounting his chariot and fleeing to Jerusalem, Ahab riding in
his chariot from Samaria to Jezreel, with Elijah running before
him; and in the New Testament we read of the chariot in
which sat the chief eunuch of Ethiopia whom Philip baptized
(Acts viii. 28).</p>

<p>As to the precise form and character of these chariots, they are
made familiar to us by the sculptures and paintings of Egypt and
Assyria, from both of which countries the Jews procured the
vehicles. Differing very slightly in shape, the principle of the
chariot was the same; and it strikes us with some surprise that
the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Jews, the three wealthiest
and most powerful nations of the world, should not have invented
a better carriage. They lavished the costliest materials and
the most artistic skill in decorating the chariots, but had no idea
of making them comfortable for the occupants.</p>

<p>They were nothing but semicircular boxes on wheels, and of
very small size. They were hung very low, so that the occupants
could step in and out without trouble, though they do not
seem to have had the sloping floor of the Greek or Roman
chariot. They had no springs, but, in order to render the jolting
of the carriage less disagreeable, the floor was made of a sort of
network of leathern ropes, very tightly stretched so as to be
elastic. The wheels were always two in number, and generally
had six spokes.</p>

<p>To the side of the chariot was attached the case which contained
the bow and quiver of arrows, and in the case of a rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
man these bow-cases were covered with gold and silver, and
adorned with figures of lions and other animals. Should the
chariot be intended for two persons, two bow-cases were fastened
to it, the one crossing the other. The spear had also its tubular
case, in which it was kept upright, like the whip of a modern
carriage.</p>

<p>Two Horses were generally used with each chariot, though
three were sometimes employed. They were harnessed very
simply, having no traces, and being attached to the central pole
by a breast-band, a very slight saddle, and a loose girth. On
their heads were generally fixed ornaments, such as tufts of
feathers, and similar decorations, and tassels hung to the harness
served to drive away the flies. Round the neck of each Horse
passed a strap, to the end of which was attached a bell. This
ornament is mentioned in Zech. xiv. 20: "In that day shall
there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness unto the Lord"&mdash;i.e.
the greeting of peace shall be on the bells of the animals
once used in war.</p>

<p>Sometimes the owner drove his own chariot, even when going
into battle, but the usual plan was to have a driver, who managed
the Horses while the owner or occupant could fight with both
his hands at liberty. In case he drove his own Horse, the reins
passed round his waist, and the whip was fastened to the wrist
by a thong, so that when the charioteer used the bow, his principal
weapon, he could do so without danger of losing his whip.</p>

<p>Thus much for the use of the chariot in war; we have now
the Horse as the animal ridden by the cavalry.</p>

<p>As was the case with the chariot, the war-horse was not
employed by the Jews until a comparatively late period of their
history. They had been familiarized with cavalry during their
long sojourn in Egypt, and in the course of their war of conquest
had often suffered defeat from the horsemen of the enemy. But
we do not find any mention of a mounted force as forming
part of the Jewish army until the days of David, although
after that time the successive kings possessed large forces
of cavalry.</p>

<p>Many references to mounted soldiers are made by the prophets,
sometimes allegorically, sometimes metaphorically. See, for
example, Jer. vi. 23: "They shall lay hold on bow and spear;
they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war
against thee, O daughter of Zion." The same prophet has a
similar passage in chap. l. 42, couched in almost precisely the
same words. And in chap. xlvi. 4, there is a further reference
to the cavalry, which is specially valuable as mentioning the
weapons used by them. The first call of the prophet is to the
infantry: "Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to
battle" (verse 3); and then follows the command to the cavalry,
"Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth
with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines."
The chief arms of the Jewish soldier were therefore
the cuirass, the helmet, and the lance, the weapons which in all
ages, and in all countries, have been found to be peculiarly
suitable to the horse-soldier.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being desirous of affording the reader a pictorial representation
of the war and state chariots, I have selected Egypt as the
typical country of the former, and Assyria of the latter. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
have been executed with the greatest care in details,
every one of which, even to the harness of the Horses, the mode
of holding the reins, the form of the whip, and the offensive
and defensive armour, has been copied from the ancient records
of Egypt and Nineveh.</p>

<p>We will first take the war-chariot of Egypt.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="ancient" id="ancient"></a>
<img src="images/i_308.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="ancient" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ANCIENT BATTLE-FIELD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This form has been selected as the type of the war-chariot
because the earliest account of such a force mentions the war-chariots
of Egypt, and because, after the Israelites had adopted
chariots as an acknowledged part of their army, the vehicles, as
well as the trained Horses, and probably their occupants, were
procured from Egypt.</p>

<p>The scene represents a battle between the imperial forces and
a revolted province, so that the reader may have the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of seeing the various kinds of weapons and armour
which were in use in Egypt at the time of Joseph. In the
foreground is the chariot of the general, driven at headlong
speed, the Horses at full gallop, and the springless chariot leaping
off the ground as the Horses bound along. The royal rank of the
general in question is shown by the feather fan which denotes
his high birth, and which is fixed in a socket at the back of his
chariot, much as a coachman fixes his whip. The rank of the
rider is further shown by the feather plumes on the heads of his
Horses.</p>

<p>By the side of the chariot are seen the quiver and bow-case,
the former being covered with decorations, and having
the figure of a recumbent lion along its sides. The simple
but effective harness of the Horses is especially worthy of
notice, as showing how the ancients knew, better than the
moderns, that to cover a Horse with a complicated apparatus
of straps and metal only deteriorates from the powers of the
animal, and that a Horse is more likely to behave well if he
can see freely on all sides, than if all lateral vision be cut off by
the use of blinkers.</p>

<p>Just behind the general is the chariot of another officer, one
of whose Horses has been struck, and is lying struggling on the
ground. The general is hastily giving his orders as he dashes
past the fallen animal. On the ground are lying the bodies of
some slain enemies, and the Horses are snorting and shaking
their heads, significative of their unwillingness to trample on a
human being. By the side of the dead man are his shield, bow,
and quiver, and it is worthy of notice that the form of these
weapons, as depicted upon the ancient Egyptian monuments, is
identical with that which is still found among several half-savage
tribes of Africa.</p>

<p>In the background is seen the fight raging round the standards.
One chief has been killed, and while the infantry are pressing
round the body of the rebel leader and his banner on one side,
on the other the imperial chariots are thundering along to
support the attack, and are driving their enemies before them.
In the distance are seen the clouds of dust whirled into the air
by the hoofs and wheels, and circling in clouds by the eddies
caused by the fierce rush of the vehicles, thus illustrating the
passage in Jer. iv. 13: "Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than
eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled." The reader will see,
by reference to the illustration, how wonderfully true and forcible
is this statement, the writer evidently having been an eye-witness
of the scene which he so powerfully depicts.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="chariot" id="chariot"></a>
<img src="images/i_310.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="chariot" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CHARIOT OF STATE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The second scene is intentionally chosen as affording a strong
contrast to the former. Here, instead of the furious rush, the
galloping Horses, the chariots leaping off the ground, the
archers bending their bows, and all imbued with the fierce ardour
of battle, we have a scene of quiet grandeur, the Assyrian king
making a solemn progress in his chariot after a victory, accompanied
by his attendants, and surrounded by his troops, in all
the placid splendour of Eastern state.</p>

<p>Chief object in the illustration stands the great king in his
chariot, wearing the regal crown, or mitre, and sheltered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the sun by the umbrella, which in ancient Nineveh, as in more
modern times, was the emblem of royalty. By his side is his
charioteer, evidently a man of high rank, holding the reins in a
business-like manner; and in front marches the shield-bearer.
In one of the sculptures from which this illustration was composed,
the shield-bearer was clearly a man of rank, fat, fussy,
full of importance, and evidently a portrait of some well-known
individual.</p>

<p>The Horses are harnessed with remarkable lightness, but they
bear the gorgeous trappings which befit the rank of the rider,
their heads being decorated with the curious successive plumes
with which the Assyrian princes distinguished their chariot
Horses, and the breast-straps being adorned with tassels, repeated
in successive rows like the plumes of the head.</p>

<p>The reader will probably notice the peculiar high action of the
Horses. This accomplishment seems to have been even more
valued among the ancients than by ourselves, and some of the
sculptures show the Horses with their knees almost touching
their noses. Of course the artist exaggerrated the effect that
he wanted to produce; but the very fact of the exaggeration
shows the value that was set on a high and showy action in a
Horse that was attached to a chariot of state. The old Assyrian
sculptors knew the Horse well, and delineated it in a most
spirited and graphic style, though they treated it rather conventionally.
The variety of attitude is really wonderful, considering
that all the figures are profile views, as indeed seemed to have
been a law of the historical sculptures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before closing this account of the Horse, it may be as well
to remark the singular absence of detail in the Scriptural
accounts. Of the other domesticated animals many such
details are given, but of the Horse we hear but little, except in
connexion with war. There are few exceptions to this rule, and
even the oft-quoted passage in Job, which goes deeper into the
character of the Horse than any other portion of the Scriptures,
only considers the Horse as an auxiliary in battle. We miss the
personal interest in the animal which distinguishes the many
references to the ox, the sheep, and the goat; and it is
remarkable that even in the Book of Proverbs, which is so
rich in references to various animals, very little is said of the
Horse.</p>

<h2>THE ASS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Importance of the Ass in the East&mdash;Its general use for the saddle&mdash;Riding the Ass
not a mark of humility&mdash;The triumphal entry&mdash;White Asses&mdash;Character of the
Scriptural Ass&mdash;Saddling the Ass&mdash;Samson and Balaam.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the Scriptures we read of two breeds of Ass, namely, the
Domesticated and the Wild Ass. As the former is the more
important of the two, we will give it precedence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the East, the Ass has always played a much more
important part than among us Westerns, and on that account we
find it so frequently mentioned in the Bible. In the first place,
it is the universal saddle-animal of the East. Among us the
Ass has ceased to be regularly used for the purposes of the
saddle, and is only casually employed by holiday-makers and the
like. Some persons certainly ride it habitually, but they almost
invariably belong to the lower orders, and are content to ride
without a saddle, balancing themselves in some extraordinary
manner just over the animal's tail. In the East, however, it is
ridden by persons of the highest rank, and is decorated with
saddle and harness as rich as those of the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>So far from the use of the Ass as a saddle-animal being a
mark of humility, it ought to be viewed in precisely the opposite
light. In consequence of the very natural habit of reading,
according to Western ideas, the Scriptures, which are books
essentially Oriental in all their allusions and tone of thought,
many persons have entirely perverted the sense of one very familiar
passage, the prophecy of Zechariah concerning the future
Messiah. "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter
of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just,
and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
colt the foal of an ass" (Zech. ix. 9).</p>

<p>Now this passage, as well as the one which describes its fulfilment
so many years afterwards, has often been seized upon as
a proof of the meekness and lowliness of our Saviour, in riding
upon so humble an animal when He made His entry into Jerusalem.
The fact is, that there was no humility in the case,
neither was the act so understood by the people. He rode upon
an Ass as any prince or ruler would have done who was engaged
on a peaceful journey, the horse being reserved for war purposes.
He rode on the Ass, and not on the horse, because He was the
Prince of Peace and not of war, as indeed is shown very clearly
in the context. For, after writing the words which have just
been quoted, Zechariah proceeds as follows (ver. 10): "And I
will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem,
and the battle bow shall be cut off: and He shall speak
peace unto the heathen: and His dominion shall be from sea
even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth."</p>

<p>Meek and lowly was He, as became the new character,
hitherto unknown to the warlike and restless Jews, a Prince,
not of war, as had been all other celebrated kings, but of peace.
Had He come as the Jews expected&mdash;despite so many prophecies&mdash;their
Messiah to come, as a great king and conqueror,
He might have ridden the war-horse, and been surrounded with
countless legions of armed men. But He came as the herald of
peace, and not of war; and, though meek and lowly, yet a
Prince, riding as became a prince, on an Ass colt which had
borne no inferior burden.</p>

<p>That the act was not considered as one of lowliness is evident
from the manner in which it was received by the people,
accepting Him as the Son of David, coming in the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Highest, and greeting Him with the cry of "Hosanna!"
("Save us now,") quoted from verses 25, 26 of Ps. cxviii.:
"Save now, I beseech Thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech Thee,
send now prosperity."</p>

<p>"Blessed be He that cometh in the name of the Lord."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ENTERING JERUSALEM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The palm-branches which they strewed upon the road were
not chosen by the attendant crowd merely as a means of doing
honour to Him whom they acknowledged as the Son of David.
They were necessarily connected with the cry of "Hosanna!"
At the Feast of Tabernacles, it was customary for the people to
assemble with branches of palms and willows in their hands,
and for one of the priests to recite the Great Hallel, <em>i.e.</em> Ps. cxiii.
and cxviii. At certain intervals, the people responded with
the cry of "Hosanna!" waving at the same time their palm-branches.
For the whole of the seven days through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
feast lasted they repeated their Hosannas, always accompanying
the shout with the waving of palm-branches, and setting them
towards the altar as they went in procession round it.</p>

<p>Every child who could hold a palm-branch was expected to
take part in the solemnity, just as did the children on the occasion
of the triumphal entry. By degrees, the name of Hosanna
was transferred to the palm-branches themselves, as well as to
the feast, the last day being called the Great Hosanna.</p>

<p>The reader will now see the importance of this carrying of
palm-branches, accompanied with Hosannas, and that those who
used them in honour of Him whom they followed into Jerusalem
had no idea that He was acting any lowly part.</p>

<p>Again, the woman of Shunem, who rode on an Ass to meet
Elisha, a mission in which the life of her only child was involved,
was a woman of great wealth (2 Kings iv. 8), who was able not
only to receive the prophet, but to build a chamber, and furnish
it for him.</p>

<p>Not to multiply examples, we see from these passages that
the Ass of the East was held in comparatively high estimation,
being used for the purposes of the saddle, just as would a high-bred
horse among ourselves.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Ass is really a different animal. In this
country he is repressed, and seldom has an opportunity for displaying
the intellectual powers which he possesses, and which
are of a much higher order than is generally imagined. It is
rather remarkable, that when we wish to speak slightingly of
intellect we liken the individual to an Ass or a goose, not
knowing that we have selected just the quadruped and the bird
which are least worthy of such a distinction.</p>

<p>Putting aside the bird, as being at present out of place, we
shall find that the Ass is one of the cleverest of our domesticated
animals. We are apt to speak of the horse with a sort of reverence,
and of the Ass with contemptuous pity, not knowing
that, of the two animals, the Ass is by far the superior in point
of intellect. It has been well remarked by a keen observer of
nature, that if four or five horses are in a field, together with
one Ass, and there be an assailable point in the fence, the Ass
is sure to be the animal that discovers it, and leads the way
through it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Take even one of our own toil-worn animals, turned out in a
common to graze, and see the ingenuity which it displays when
persecuted by the idle boys who generally frequent such places,
and who try to ride every beast that is within their reach. It
seems to divine at once the object of the boy as he steals up to
it, and he takes a pleasure in baffling him just as he fancies that
he has succeeded in his attempt.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="asses" id="asses"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SYRIAN ASSES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Should the Ass be kindly treated, there is not an animal that
proves more docile, or even affectionate. Stripes and kicks it
resents, and sets itself distinctly against them; and, being nothing
but a slave, it follows the slavish principle of doing no work that
it can possibly avoid.</p>

<p>Now, in the East the Ass takes so much higher rank than
our own animal, that its whole demeanour and gait are different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
from those displayed by the generality of its brethren. "Why,
the very slave of slaves," writes Mr. Lowth, in his "Wanderer
in Arabia," "the crushed and grief-stricken, is so no more in
Egypt: the battered drudge has become the willing servant.
Is that active little fellow, who, with race-horse coat and full
flanks, moves under his rider with the light step and the action
of a pony&mdash;is he the same animal as that starved and head-bowed
object of the North, subject for all pity and cruelty, and
clothed with rags and insult?</p>

<p>"Look at him now. On he goes, rapid and free, with his
small head well up, and as gay as a crimson saddle and a bridle
of light chains and red leather can make him. It was a gladdening
sight to see the unfortunate as a new animal in Egypt."</p>

<p>Hardy animal as is the Ass, it is not well adapted for tolerance
of cold, and seems to degenerate in size, strength, speed, and
spirit in proportion as the climate becomes colder. Whether it
might equal the horse in its endurance of cold provided that it
were as carefully treated, is perhaps a doubtful point; but it is
a well-known fact that the horse does not necessarily degenerate
by moving towards a colder climate, though the Ass has always
been found to do so.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a variety in the treatment which the Ass
receives even in the East. Signor Pierotti, whose work on the
customs and traditions of Palestine has already been mentioned,
writes in very glowing terms of the animal. He states that he
formed a very high opinion of the Ass while he was in Egypt,
not only from its spirited aspect and its speed, but because it
was employed even by the Viceroy and the great Court officers,
who may be said to use Asses of more or less intelligence for
every occasion. He even goes so far as to say that, if all the
Asses were taken away from Egypt, travel would be impossible.</p>

<p>The same traveller gives an admirable summary of the character
of the Ass, as it exists in Egypt and Palestine. "What,
then, are the characteristics of the ass? Much the same as those
which adorn it in other parts of the East&mdash;namely, it is useful for
riding and for carrying burdens; it is sensible of kindness, and
shows gratitude; it is very steady, and is larger, stronger, and
more tractable than its European congener; its pace is easy
and pleasant; and it will shrink from no labour, if only its poor
daily feed of straw and barley is fairly given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"If well and liberally supplied, it is capable of any enterprise,
and wears an altered and dignified mien, apparently forgetful of
its extraction, except when undeservedly beaten by its masters,
who, however, are not so much to be blamed, because, having
learned to live among sticks, thongs, and rods, they follow the
same system of education with their miserable dependants.</p>

<p>"The wealthy feed him well, deck him with fine harness and
silver trappings, and cover him, when his work is done, with
rich Persian carpets. The poor do the best they can for him,
steal for his benefit, give him a corner at their fireside, and in
cold weather sleep with him for more warmth. In Palestine, all
the rich men, whether monarchs or chiefs of villages, possess
a number of asses, keeping them with their flocks, like the
patriarchs of old. No one can travel in that country, and observe
how the ass is employed for all purposes, without being struck
with the exactness with which the Arabs retain the Hebrew
customs."</p>

<p>The result of this treatment is, that the Eastern Ass is an
enduring and tolerably swift animal, vying with the camel itself
in its powers of long-continued travel, its usual pace being a
sort of easy canter. On rough ground, or up an ascent, it is said
even to gain on the horse, probably because its little sharp hoofs
give it a firm footing where the larger hoof of the horse is liable
to slip.</p>

<p>The familiar term "saddling the Ass" requires some little
explanation.</p>

<p>The saddle is not in the least like the article which we know
by that name, but is very large and complicated in structure.
Over the animal's back is first spread a cloth, made of thick
woollen stuff, and folded several times. The saddle itself is a
very thick pad of straw, covered with carpet, and flat at the top,
instead of being rounded as is the case with our saddles. The
pommel is very high, and when the rider is seated on it, he is
perched high above the back of the animal. Over the saddle is
thrown a cloth or carpet, always of bright colours, and varying
in costliness of material and ornament according to the wealth
of the possessor. It is mostly edged with a fringe and tassels.</p>

<p>The bridle is decorated, like that of the horse, with bells,
embroidery, tassels, shells, and other ornaments.</p>

<p>As we may see from 2 Kings iv. 24, the Ass was generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
guided by a driver who ran behind it, just as is done with donkeys
hired to children here. Owing to the unchanging character of the
East, there is no doubt that the "riders on asses" of the Scriptures
rode exactly after the mode which is adopted at the present day.
What that mode is, we may learn from Mr. Bayard Taylor's amusing
and vivid description of a ride through the streets of Cairo:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 402px;"><a name="cairo" id="cairo"></a>
<img src="images/i_321.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="cairo" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A STREET IN CAIRO, EGYPT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"To see Cairo thoroughly, one must first accustom himself to
the ways of these long-eared cabs, without the use of which I
would advise no one to trust himself in the bazaars. Donkey-riding
is universal, and no one thinks of going beyond the Frank
quarters on foot. If he does, he must submit to be followed by
not less than six donkeys with their drivers. A friend of mine
who was attended by such a cavalcade for two hours, was obliged
to yield at last, and made no second attempt. When we first
appeared in the gateway of an hotel, equipped for an excursion,
the rush of men and animals was so great that we were forced
to retreat until our servant and the porter whipped us a path
through the yelling and braying mob. After one or two trials
I found an intelligent Arab boy named Kish, who for five
piastres a day furnished strong and ambitious donkeys, which
he kept ready at the door from morning till night. The other
drivers respected Kish's privilege, and henceforth I had no
trouble.</p>

<p>"The donkeys are so small that my feet nearly touched the
ground, but there is no end to their strength and endurance.
Their gait, whether in pace or in gallop, is so easy and light
that fatigue is impossible. The drivers take great pride in
having high-cushioned red saddles, and in hanging bits of
jingling brass to the bridles. They keep their donkeys close
shorn, and frequently beautify them by painting them various
colours. The first animal I rode had legs barred like a zebra's,
and my friend's rejoiced in purple flanks and a yellow belly. The
drivers ran behind them with a short stick, punching them from
time to time, or giving them a sharp pinch on the rump. Very
few of them own their donkeys, and I understood their pertinacity
when I learned that they frequently received a beating
on returning home empty-handed.</p>

<p>"The passage of the bazaars seems at first quite as hazardous
on donkey-back as on foot; but it is the difference between
knocking somebody down and being knocked down yourself,
and one certainly prefers the former alternative. There is no
use in attempting to guide the donkey, for he won't be guided.
The driver shouts behind, and you are dashed at full speed into
a confusion of other donkeys, camels, horses, carts, water-carriers,
and footmen. In vain you cry out '<em>Bess</em>' (enough), '<em>Piacco</em>,'
and other desperate adjurations; the driver's only reply is: 'Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the bridle hang loose!' You dodge your head under a camel-load
of planks; your leg brushes the wheel of a dust-cart; you strike
a fat Turk plump in the back; you miraculously escape upsetting
a fruit-stand; you scatter a company of spectral, white-masked
women; and at last reach some more quiet street, with
the sensations of a man who has stormed a battery.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 179px;"><a name="beggar" id="beggar"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BEGGAR IN THE STREETS OF CAIRO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"At first this sort of riding made me very nervous, but presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
I let the donkey go his own way, and took a curious
interest in seeing how near a chance I ran of striking or being
struck. Sometimes there seemed no hope of avoiding a violent
collision; but, by a series of the most remarkable dodges, he
generally carried you through in safety. The cries of the driver
running behind gave me no little amusement. 'The hawadji
comes! Take care on the right hand! Take care on the left
hand! O man, take care! O maiden, take care! O boy, get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the way! The hawadji comes!' Kish had strong lungs, and his
donkey would let nothing pass him; and so wherever we went we
contributed our full share to the universal noise and confusion."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">NIGHT-WATCH IN CAIRO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This description explains several allusions which are made
in the Scriptures to treading down the enemies in the streets,
and to the chariots raging and jostling against each other in
the ways.</p>

<p>The Ass was used in the olden time for carrying burdens, as
it is at present, and, in all probability, carried them in the same
way. Sacks and bundles are tied firmly to the pack-saddle; but
poles, planks, and objects of similar shape are tied in a sloping
direction on the side of the saddle, the longer ends trailing on
the ground, and the shorter projecting at either side of the
animal's head. The North American Indians carry the poles of
their huts, or wigwams, in precisely the same way, tying them
on either side of their horses, and making them into rude sledges,
upon which are fastened the skins that form the walls of their
huts. The same system of carriage is also found among the
Esquimaux, and the hunters of the extreme North, who harness
their dogs in precisely the same manner. The Ass, thus laden,
becomes a very unpleasant passenger through the narrow and
crowded streets of an Oriental city; and many an unwary traveller
has found reason to remember the description of Issachar
as the strong Ass between two burdens.</p>

<p>The Ass was also used for agriculture, and was employed in
the plough, as we find from many passages. See for example,
"Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither
the feet of the ox and the ass" (Isa. xxxii. 20). Sowing beside
the waters is a custom that still prevails in all hot countries,
the margins of rivers being tilled, while outside this cultivated
belt there is nothing but desert ground.</p>

<p>The ox and the Ass were used in the first place for irrigation,
turning the machines by which water was lifted from the river,
and poured into the trenches which conveyed it to all parts of
the tilled land. If, as is nearly certain, the rude machinery of
the East is at the present day identical with those which were
used in the old Scriptural times, they were yoked to the machine
in rather an ingenious manner. The machine consists of an
upright pivot, and to it is attached the horizontal pole to which
the ox or Ass is harnessed. A machine exactly similar in principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
may be seen in almost any brick-field in England; but the
ingenious part of the Eastern water-machine is the mode in
which the animal is made to believe that it is being driven by
its keeper, whereas the man in question might be at a distance,
or fast asleep.</p>

<p>The animal is first blindfolded, and then yoked to the end of the
horizontal bar. Fixed to the pivot, and rather in front of the bar,
is one end of a slight and elastic strip of wood. The projecting
end, being drawn forward and tied to the bridle of the animal,
keeps up a continual pull, and makes the blinded animal believe
that it is being drawn forward by the hand of a driver. Some
ingenious but lazy attendants have even invented a sort of self-acting
whip, <em>i.e.</em> a stick which is lifted and allowed to fall
on the animal's back by the action of the wheel once every
round.</p>

<p>The field being properly supplied with water, the Ass is used
for ploughing it. It is worthy of mention that at the present
day the prohibition against yoking an ox and an Ass together is
often disregarded. The practice, however, is not a judicious one,
as the slow and heavy ox does not act well with the lighter and
more active animal, and, moreover, is apt to butt at its companion
with its horns in order to stimulate it to do more than its
fair proportion of the work.</p>

<p>There is a custom now in Palestine which probably existed
in the days of the Scriptures, though I have not been able to find
any reference to it. Whenever an Ass is disobedient and strays
from its master, the man who captures the trespasser on his
grounds clips a piece out of its ear before he returns it to its
owner. Each time that the animal is caught on forbidden
grounds it receives a fresh clip of the ear. By looking at
the ears of an Ass, therefore, any one can tell whether it has
ever been a straggler; and if so, he knows the number of times
that it has strayed, by merely counting the clip-marks, which
always begin at the tip of the ear, and extend along the edges.
Any Ass, no matter how handsome it may be, that has many of
those clips, is always rejected by experienced travellers, as it is
sure to be a dull as well as a disobedient beast.</p>

<p>There are recorded in the Scriptures two remarkable circumstances
connected with the Ass, which, however, need but a few
words. The first is the journey of Balaam from Pethor to Moab,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
in the course of which there occurred that singular incident of
the Ass speaking in human language (see Numb. xxii. 21, 35).
The second is the well-known episode in the story of Samson,
where he is recorded as breaking the cords with which his
enemies had bound him, and killing a thousand Philistines with
the fresh jaw-bone of an Ass.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE WILD ASS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Various allusions to the Wild Ass&mdash;Its swiftness and wildness&mdash;The Wild Ass of
Asia and Africa&mdash;How the Wild Ass is hunted&mdash;Excellence of its flesh&mdash;Meeting
a Wild Ass&mdash;Origin of the domestic Ass&mdash;The Wild Asses of Quito.</p></blockquote>


<p>There are several passages of Scripture in which the Wild Ass
is distinguished from the domesticated animal, and in all of
them there is some reference made to its swiftness, its intractable
nature, and love of freedom. It is an astonishingly swift
animal, so that on the level ground even the best horse has
scarcely a chance of overtaking it. It is exceedingly wary, its
sight, hearing, and sense of scent being equally keen, so that to
approach it by craft is a most difficult task.</p>

<p>Like many other wild animals, it has a custom of ascending
hills or rising grounds, and thence surveying the country, and
even in the plains it will generally contrive to discover some
earth-mound or heap of sand from which it may act as sentinel
and give the alarm in case of danger. It is a gregarious animal,
always assembling in herds, varying from two or three to several
hundred in number, and has a habit of partial migration in
search of green food, traversing large tracts of country in its
passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>It has a curiously intractable disposition, and, even when
captured very young, can scarcely ever be brought to bear a
burden or draw a vehicle.</p>

<p>Attempts have been often made to domesticate the young
that have been born in captivity, but with very slight success,
the wild nature of the animal constantly breaking out,
even when it appears to have become moderately tractable.</p>

<p>Although the Wild Ass does not seem to have lived within
the limits of the Holy Land, it was common enough in the
surrounding country, and, from the frequent references made
to it in Scriptures, was well known to the ancient Jews.</p>

<p>We will now look at the various passages in which the Wild
Ass is mentioned, and begin with the splendid description in Job
xxxix. 5-8:</p>

<p>"Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed
the bands of the wild ass?</p>

<p>"Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren
lands (or salt places) his dwellings.</p>

<p>"He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he
the crying of the driver.</p>

<p>"The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
after every green thing."</p>

<p>Here we have the animal described with the minuteness and
truth of detail that can only be found in personal knowledge;
its love of freedom, its avoidance of mankind, and its migration
in search of pasture.</p>

<p>Another allusion to the pasture-seeking habits of the animal is
to be found in chapter vi. of the same book, verse 5: "Doth the
wild ass bray when he hath grass?" or, according to the version
of the Jewish Bible, "over tender grass?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very vivid account of the appearance of the animal in its
wild state is given by Sir R. Kerr Porter, who was allowed by
a Wild Ass to approach within a moderate distance, the animal
evidently seeing that he was not one of the people to whom it
was accustomed, and being curious enough to allow the stranger
to approach him.</p>

<p>"The sun was just rising over the summit of the eastern
mountains, when my greyhound started off in pursuit of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
animal which, my Persians said, from the glimpse they had of
it, was an antelope. I instantly put spurs to my horse, and
with my attendants gave chase. After an unrelaxed gallop of
three miles, we came up with the dog, who was then within a
short stretch of the creature he pursued; and to my surprise,
and at first vexation, I saw it to be an ass.</p>

<p>"Upon reflection, however, judging from its fleetness that it
must be a wild one, a creature little known in Europe, but which
the Persians prize above all other animals as an object of chase,
I determined to approach as near to it as the very swift Arab I
was on could carry me. But the single instant of checking my
horse to consider had given our game such a head of us that,
notwithstanding our speed, we could not recover our ground
on him.</p>

<p>"I, however, happened to be considerably before my companions,
when, at a certain distance, the animal in its turn made
a pause, and allowed me to approach within pistol-shot of him.
He then darted off again with the quickness of thought, capering,
kicking, and sporting in his flight, as if he were not blown in
the least, and the chase was his pastime. When my followers
of the country came up, they regretted that I had not shot the
creature when he was within my aim, telling me that his flesh
is one of the greatest delicacies in Persia.</p>

<p>"The prodigious swiftness and the peculiar manner in which
he fled across the plain coincided exactly with the description
that Xenophon gives of the same animal in Arabia. But above
all, it reminded me of the striking portrait drawn by the author
of the Book of Job. I was informed by the Mehnander, who
had been in the desert when making a pilgrimage to the shrine
of Ali, that the wild ass of Irak Arabi differs in nothing from
the one I had just seen. He had observed them often for a
short time in the possession of the Arabs, who told him the
creature was perfectly untameable.</p>

<p>"A few days after this discussion, we saw another of these
animals, and, pursuing it determinately, had the good fortune
to kill it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been suggested by many zoologists that the Wild Ass
is the progenitor of the domesticated species. The origin of the
domesticated animal, however, is so very ancient, that we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a><br /><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
no data whereon even a theory can be built. It is true that the
Wild and the Domesticated Ass are exactly similar in appearance,
and that an <em>Asinus hemippus</em>, or Wild Ass, looks so like an
Asiatic <em>Asinus vulgaris</em>, or Domesticated Ass, that by the eye
alone the two are hardly distinguishable from each other. But
with their appearance the resemblance ends, the domestic animal
being quiet, docile, and fond of man, while the wild animal is
savage, intractable, and has an invincible repugnance to human
beings.</p>

<img src="images/i_330.jpg" width="332" height="600" alt="hunt" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HUNTING WILD ASSES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This diversity of spirit in similar forms is very curious, and
is strongly exemplified by the semi-wild Asses of Quito. They
are the descendants of the animals that were imported by the
Spaniards, and live in herds, just as do the horses. They combine
the habits of the Wild Ass with the disposition of the tame
animal. They are as swift of foot as the Wild Ass of Syria or
Africa, and have the same habit of frequenting lofty situations,
leaping about among rocks and ravines, which seem only fitted
for the wild goat, and into which no horse can follow them.</p>

<p>Nominally, they are private property, but practically they
may be taken by any one who chooses to capture them. The
lasso is employed for the purpose, and when the animals are
caught they bite, and kick, and plunge, and behave exactly like
their wild relations of the Old World, giving their captors infinite
trouble in avoiding the teeth and hoofs which they wield so
skilfully. But, as soon as a load has once been bound on the
back of one of these furious creatures, the wild spirit dies
out of it, the head droops, the gait becomes steady, and the
animal behaves as if it had led a domesticated life all its days.</p>

<h2>THE MULE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Ancient use of the Mule&mdash;Various breeds of Mule&mdash;Supposed date of its introduction
into Palestine&mdash;Mule-breeding forbidden to the Jews&mdash;The Mule as a saddle-animal&mdash;Its
use on occasions of state&mdash;The king's Mule&mdash;Obstinacy of the
Mule.</p></blockquote>


<p>There are several references to the <span class="smcap">Mule</span> in the Holy Scriptures,
but it is remarkable that the animal is not mentioned at
all until the time of David, and that in the New Testament the
name does not occur at all.</p>

<p>The origin of the Mule is unknown, but that the mixed breed
between the horse and the ass has been employed in many
countries from very ancient times is a familiar fact. It is a very
strange circumstance that the offspring of these two animals
should be, for some purposes, far superior to either of the
parents, a well-bred Mule having the lightness, surefootedness,
and hardy endurance of the ass, together with the increased size
and muscular development of the horse. Thus it is peculiarly
adapted either for the saddle or for the conveyance of burdens
over a rough or desert country.</p>

<p>The Mules that are most generally serviceable are bred from
the male ass and the mare, those which have the horse as the
father and the ass as the mother being small, and comparatively
valueless. At the present day, Mules are largely employed in
Spain and the Spanish dependencies, and there are some breeds
which are of very great size and singular beauty, those of
Andalusia being especially celebrated. In the Andes, the Mule
has actually superseded the llama as a beast of burden.</p>

<p>Its appearance in the sacred narrative is quite sudden. In
Gen. xxxvi. 24, there is a passage which seems as if it referred
to the Mule: "This was that Anah that found the mules in the
wilderness." Now the word which is here rendered as Mules is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
"Yemim," a word which is not found elsewhere in the Hebrew
Scriptures. The best Hebraists are agreed that, whatever interpretation
may be put upon the word, it cannot possibly have
the signification that is here assigned to it. Some translate
the word as "hot springs," while the editors of the Jewish Bible
prefer to leave it untranslated, thus signifying that they are not
satisfied with any rendering.</p>

</div>

<p>The word which is properly translated as Mule is "Pered;"
and the first place where it occurs is 2 Sam. xiii. 29. Absalom
had taken advantage of a sheep-shearing feast to kill his brother
Amnon in revenge for the insult offered to Tamar: "And the
servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him
up upon his mule, and fled." It is evident from this passage
that the Mule must have been in use for a considerable time,
as the sacred writer mentions, as a matter of course, that the
king's sons had each his own riding mule.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="absalom" id="absalom"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ABSALOM IS CAUGHT IN THE BOUGHS OF AN OAK TREE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Farther on, chap. xviii. 9 records the event which led to
the death of Absalom by the hand of Joab. "And Absalom
met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule,
and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and
his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between
the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him
went away."</p>

<p>We see by these passages that the Mule was held in such
high estimation that it was used by the royal princes for the
saddle, and had indeed superseded the ass. In another passage
we shall find that the Mule was ridden by the king himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
when he travelled in state, and that to ride upon the king's
Mule was considered as equivalent to sitting upon the king's
throne. See, for example, 1 Kings i. in which there are several
passages illustrative of this curious fact. See first, ver. 33, in
which David gives to Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,
and Benaiah the captain of the hosts, instructions for bringing
his son Solomon to Gihon, and anointing him king in the stead
of his father: "Take with you the servants of your lord, and
cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring
him down to Gihon."</p>

<p>That the Mule was as obstinate and contentious an animal
in Palestine as it is in Europe is evident from the fact that
the Eastern mules of the present day are quite as troublesome
as their European brethren. They are very apt to shy at
anything, or nothing at all; they bite fiercely, and every now and
then they indulge in a violent kicking fit, flinging out their
heels with wonderful force and rapidity, and turning round and
round on their fore-feet so quickly that it is hardly possible to
approach them. There is scarcely a traveller in the Holy Land
who has not some story to tell about the Mule and its perverse
disposition; but, as these anecdotes have but very slight bearing
on the subject of the Mule as mentioned in the Scriptures, they
will not be given in these pages.</p>

</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SWINE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Mosaic prohibition of the pig&mdash;Hatred of Swine by Jews and Mahometans&mdash;The
prodigal son&mdash;Supposed connexion between Swine and diseases of the skin&mdash;Destruction
of the herd of Swine&mdash;The wild boar of the woods&mdash;The damage
which it does to the vines.</p></blockquote>


<p>Many are the animals which are specially mentioned in the
Mosaic law as unfit for food, beside those that come under the
general head of being unclean because they do not divide the
hoof and chew the cud. There is none, however, that excited
such abhorrence as the hog, or that was more utterly detested.</p>

<p>It is utterly impossible for a European, especially one of the
present day, to form even an idea of the utter horror and loathing
with which the hog was regarded by the ancient Jews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Even at the present day, a zealous Jew or Mahometan looks
upon the hog, or anything that belongs to the hog, with an
abhorrence too deep for words. The older and stricter Jews felt
so deeply on this subject, that they would never even mention
the name of the hog, but always substituted for the objectionable
word the term "the abomination."</p>

<p>Several references are made in the Scriptures to the exceeding
disgust felt by the Jews towards the Swine. The portion of
the Mosaic law on which a Jew would ground his antipathy to
the flesh of Swine is that passage which occurs in Lev. xi. 7:
"And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven-footed,
yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you." But
the very same paragraph, of which this passage forms the termination,
treats of other unclean beasts, such as the coney (or
hyrax) and the hare, neither of which animals are held in such
abhorrence as the Swine.</p>

<p>This enactment could not therefore have produced the singular
feeling with which the Swine were regarded by the Jews,
and in all probability the antipathy was of far greater antiquity
than the time of Moses.</p>

<p>How hateful to the Jewish mind was the hog we may infer
from many passages, several of which occur in the Book of
Isaiah. See, for example, lxv. 3, 4: "A people that provoketh
me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in
gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</p>

<p>"Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments,
which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things
is in their vessels." Here we have the people heaping one
abomination upon another&mdash;the sacrifice to idols in the gardens,
the burning of incense upon a forbidden altar and with strange
fire, the living among the tombs, where none but madmen and
evil spirits were supposed to reside, and, as the culminating
point of iniquity, eating Swine's flesh, and drinking the broth
in which it was boiled.</p>

<p>In the next chapter, verse 3, we have another reference to the
Swine. Speaking of the wickedness of the people, and the
uselessness of their sacrifices, the prophet proceeds to say: "He
that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a
lamb, as if he had cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an
oblation, as if he offered swine's blood." We see here how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
prophet proceeds from one image to another: the murder of a
man, the offering of a dog instead of a lamb, and the pouring
out of Swine's blood upon the altar instead of wine&mdash;the last-mentioned
crime being evidently held as the worst of the three.
Another reference to the Swine occurs in the same chapter,
verse 17: "They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves
in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's
flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed
together, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>Not only did the Jews refuse to eat the flesh of the hog, but
they held in utter abomination everything that belonged to it,
and would have thought themselves polluted had they been even
touched with a hog's bristle. Even at the present day this feeling
has not diminished, and both by Jews and Mahometans the
hog is held in utter abhorrence.</p>

<p>Some recent travellers have made great use of this feeling.
Signor Pierotti, for example, during his long sojourn in Palestine,
found the flesh of the hog extremely beneficial to him. "How
often has the flesh of this animal supported me, especially during
the earlier part of my stay in Palestine, before I had learned to
like the mutton and the goats' flesh! I give the preference to
this meat because it has often saved me time by rendering a fire
unnecessary, and freed me from importunate, dirty, and unsavoury
guests, who used their hands for spoons, knives, and forks.</p>

<p>"A little piece of bacon laid conspicuously upon the cloth
that served me for a table was always my best friend. Without
this talisman I should never have freed myself from unwelcome
company, at least without breaking all the laws of hospitality
by not inviting the chiefs of my escort or the guides to share my
meal; a thing neither prudent nor safe in the open country.
Therefore, on the contrary, when thus provided I pressed them
with the utmost earnestness to eat with me, but of course never
succeeded in persuading them; and so dined in peace, keeping
on good terms with them, although they did call me behind my
back a 'dog of a Frank' for eating pork.</p>

<p>"Besides, I had then no fear of my stores failing, as I always
took care to carry a stock large enough to supply the real wants
of my party. So a piece of bacon was more service to me than
a revolver, a rifle, or a sword; and I recommend all travellers in
Palestine to carry bacon rather than arms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Such being the feelings of the Jews, we may conceive the
abject degradation to which the Prodigal Son of the parable
must have descended, when he was compelled to become a
swine-herd for a living, and would have been glad even to have
eaten the very husks on which the Swine fed. These husks, by
the way, were evidently the pods of the locust-tree, or carob, of
which we shall have more to say in a future page. We have in
our language no words to express the depths of ignominy into
which this young man must have fallen, nor can we conceive
any office which in our estimation would be so degrading as
would be that of swine-herd to a Jew.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PRODIGAL SON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>How deeply rooted was the abhorrence of the Swine's flesh
we can see from a passage in 2 Maccabees, in which is related a
series of insults offered to the religion of the Jews. The temple
in Jerusalem was to be called the Temple of Jupiter Olympus,
and that on Gerizim was to be dedicated to Jupiter, the defender
of strangers. The altars were defiled by forbidden things, and the
celebration of the Sabbath, or of any Jewish ceremony, was
punishable with death.</p>

<p>Severe as were all these afflictions, there was one which the
Jews seem, from the stress laid upon it, to have felt more keenly
than any other. This was the compulsory eating of Swine's
flesh, an act which was so abhorrent to the Jews that in
attempting to enforce it, Antiochus found that he was foiled by
the passive resistance offered to him. The Jews had allowed
their temples to be dedicated to the worship of heathen deities,
they had submitted to the deprivation of their sacred rites, they
had even consented to walk in procession on the Feast of
Bacchus, carrying ivy like the rest of the worshippers in that
most licentious festival. It might be thought that any people
who submit to such degradation would suffer any similar indignity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
But even their forbearance had reached its limits, and
nothing could induce them to eat the flesh of Swine.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="swine" id="swine"></a>
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" width="400" height="595" alt="swine" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ELEAZAR REFUSES TO EAT SWINE'S FLESH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Several examples of the resistance offered by them are recorded
in the book just mentioned. Eleazer, for example, a man
ninety years old, sternly refused to partake of the abominable
food. Some of the officials, in compassion for his great age,
advised him to take lawful meat with him and to exchange it for
the Swine's flesh. This he refused to do, saying that his age
was only a reason for particular care on his part, lest the young
should be led away by his example. His persecutors then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
forced the meat into his mouth, but he rejected it, and died
under the lash.</p>

<p>Another example of similar, but far greater heroism, is given
by the same chronicler. A mother and her seven sons were
urged with blows to eat the forbidden food, and refused to do
so. Thinking that the mother would not be able to endure the
sight of her sons' sufferings, the officers took them in succession,
and inflicted a series of horrible tortures upon them, beginning
by cutting off their tongues, hands, and feet, and ending by
roasting them while still alive. Their mother, far from counselling
her sons to yield, even though they were bribed by promises
of wealth and rank, only encouraged them to persevere, and,
when the last of her sons was dead, passed herself through the
same fiery trial.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A MOTHER AND HER SEVEN SONS TORTURED FOR REFUSING TO EAT SWINE'S FLESH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has been conjectured, and with plausibility, that the pig
was prohibited by Moses on account of the unwholesomeness of
its flesh in a hot country, and that its almost universal repudiation
in such lands is a proof of its unfitness for food. In countries
where diseases of the skin are so common, and where the
dreaded leprosy still maintains its hold, the flesh of the pig is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
thought, whether rightly or wrongly, to increase the tendency to
such diseases, and on that account alone would be avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="evil" id="evil"></a>
<img src="images/i_342.jpg" width="400" height="516" alt="evil" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE EVIL SPIRITS ENTER A HERD OF SWINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has, however, been shown that the flesh of Swine can be
habitually consumed in hot countries without producing any
evil results; and, moreover, that the prohibition of Moses was
not confined to the Swine, but included many other animals
whose flesh is used without scruple by those very persons who
reject that of the pig.</p>

<p>Knowing the deep hatred of the Jews towards this animal,
we may naturally wonder how we come to hear of herds of
Swine kept in Jewish lands.</p>

<p>Of this custom there is a familiar example in the herd of
Swine that was drowned in the sea (Matt. viii. 28-34). It is
an open question whether those who possessed the Swine were
Jews of lax principles, who disregarded the Law for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
of gain, or whether they were Gentiles, who, of course, were not
bound by the Law. The former seems the likelier interpretation,
the destruction of the Swine being a fitting punishment for their
owners. It must be here remarked, that our Lord did not, as is
often said, destroy the Swine, neither did He send the devils into
them, so that the death of these animals cannot be reckoned as
one of the divine miracles. Ejecting the evil spirits from the
maniacs was an exercise of His divine authority; the destruction
of the Swine was a manifestation of diabolical anger, permitted,
but not dictated.</p>

<p>Swine are at the present day much neglected in Palestine,
because the Mahometans and Jews may not eat the flesh, and the
Christians, as a rule, abstain from it, so that they may not hurt
the feelings of their neighbours. Pigs are, however, reared in the
various monasteries, and by the Arabs attached to them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WILD BOARS DEVOURING THE CARCASE OF A DEER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We now come to the wild animal. There is only one passage
in the Scriptures in which the <span class="smcap">Wild Boar</span> is definitely mentioned,
and another in which a reference is made to it in a
paraphrase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 354px;"><a name="wilder" id="wilder"></a>
<img src="images/i_344.jpg" width="354" height="600" alt="wilder" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WILD BOARS.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The former of these is the well-known verse of the Psalms:
"Why hast thou broken down her hedges, so that all they which
pass by the way do pluck her?</p>

<p>"The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast
of the field doth devour it" (Ps. lxxx. 12, 13). The second
passage is to be found in Ps. lxviii. 30. In the Authorized
Version it is thus rendered: "Rebuke the company of spearmen,
the multitude of bulls, with the calves of the people." If the
reader will refer to the marginal translation (which, it must be
remarked, is of equal authority with the text), the passage runs
thus: "Rebuke the beasts of the reeds," &amp;c. Now, this is
undoubtedly the correct rendering, and is accepted in the Jewish
Bible.</p>

<p>Having quoted these two passages, we will proceed to the
description and character of the animal.</p>

<p>In the former times, the Wild Boar was necessarily much
more plentiful than is the case in these days, owing to the
greater abundance of woods, many of which have disappeared
by degrees, and others been greatly thinned by the encroachments
of mankind. Woods and reed-beds are always the habitations
of the Wild Boar, which resides in these fastnesses, and
seems always to prefer the reed-bed to the wood, probably
because it can find plenty of mud, in which it wallows after the
fashion of its kind. There is no doubt whatever that the "beast
of the reeds" is simply a poetical phrase for the Wild Boar.</p>

<p>If there should be any cultivated ground in the neighbourhood,
the Boar is sure to sally out and do enormous damage to
the crops. It is perhaps more dreaded in the vineyards than in
any other ground, as it not only devours the grapes, but tears
down and destroys the vines, trampling them under foot, and
destroying a hundredfold as much as it eats.</p>

<p>If the reader will refer again to Ps. lxxx. he will see that the
Jewish nation is described under the image of a vine: "Thou
hast brought a vine out of Egypt: Thou hast cast out the
heathen and planted it," &amp;c. No image of a destructive enemy
could therefore be more appropriate than that which is used.
We have read of the little foxes that spoil the vines, but the
Wild Boar is a much more destructive enemy, breaking its way
through the fences, rooting up the ground, tearing down the vines
themselves, and treading them under its feet. A single party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a><br /><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of these animals will sometimes destroy an entire vineyard in
a single night.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 334px;"><a name="vineyard" id="vineyard"></a>
<img src="images/i_346.jpg" width="334" height="600" alt="vineyard" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WILD BOARS DESTROYING A VINEYARD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We can well imagine the damage that would be done to a
vineyard even by the domesticated Swine, but the Wild Boar
is infinitely more destructive. It is of very great size, often
resembling a donkey rather than a boar, and is swift and active
beyond conception. The Wild Boar is scarcely recognisable as
the very near relation of the domestic species. It runs with
such speed, that a high-bred horse finds some difficulty in overtaking
it, while an indifferent steed would be left hopelessly
behind. Even on level ground the hunter has hard work to
overtake it; and if it can get upon broken or hilly ground, no
horse can catch it. The Wild Boar can leap to a considerable
distance, and can wheel and turn when at full speed, with an
agility that makes it a singularly dangerous foe. Indeed, the
inhabitants of countries where the Wild Boar flourishes would
as soon face a lion as one of these animals, the stroke of whose
razor-like tusks is made with lightning swiftness, and which is
sufficient to rip up a horse, and cut a dog nearly asunder.</p>

<p>Although the Wild Boar is not as plentiful in Palestine as
used to be the case, it is still found in considerable numbers.
Whenever the inhabitants can contrive to cut off the retreat of
marauding parties among the crops, they turn out for a general
hunt, and kill as many as they can manage to slay. After one
of these hunts, the bodies are mostly exposed for sale, but, as the
demand for them is very small, they can be purchased at a very
cheap rate. Signor Pierotti bought one in the plains of Jericho
for five shillings. For the few who may eat the hog, this is a
fortunate circumstance, the flesh being very excellent, and as
superior to ordinary pork as is a pheasant to a barn-door fowl
or venison to mutton.</p>

<h2>THE ELEPHANT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Elephant indirectly mentioned in the Authorized Version&mdash;The Elephant as
an engine of war&mdash;Antiochus and his Elephants&mdash;Oriental exaggeration&mdash;Self-devotion
of Eleazar&mdash;Attacking the Elephants, and their gradual abandonment
in war.</p></blockquote>


<p>Except indirectly, the Elephant is never mentioned in the
Authorized Version of the Canonical Scriptures, although frequent
references are made to ivory, the product of that animal.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of ivory in the Scriptures is to be found
in 1 Kings x. 18: "Moreover the king (<em>i.e.</em> Solomon) made a
great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold." This
passage forms a portion of the description given by the sacred
historian of the glories of Solomon's palace, of which this celebrated
throne, with the six steps and the twelve lions on the
steps, was the central and most magnificent object. It is named
together with the three hundred golden shields, the golden vessel
of the royal palace, and the wonderful arched viaduct crossing
the valley of the Tyrop&oelig;on, "the ascent by which he went up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
unto the house of the Lord," all of which glories so overcame
the Queen of Sheba that "there was no more spirit in her."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="sheba" id="sheba"></a>
<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="sheba" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KING SOLOMON, SEATED UPON HIS THRONE, RECEIVES THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We see, therefore, that in the time of Solomon ivory was so
precious an article that it was named among the chief of the
wonders to be seen in the palace of Solomon, the wealthiest and
most magnificent monarch of sacred or profane history.</p>

<p>That it should not have been previously mentioned is very
singular. Five hundred years had elapsed since the Israelites
escaped from the power of Egypt, and during the whole of that
time, though gold and silver and precious stones and costly
raiment are repeatedly mentioned, we do not find a single passage
in which any allusion is made to ivory. Had we not
known that ivory was largely used among the Egyptians, such
an omission would cause no surprise. But the researches of
modern travellers have brought to light many articles of ivory
that were in actual use in Egypt, and we therefore cannot but
wonder that a material so valued and so beautiful does not seem
to have been reckoned among the treasures which were brought
by the Israelites from the land of their captivity, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a><br /><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
were so abundant that the Tabernacle was entirely formed of
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 330px;"><a name="elephants" id="elephants"></a>
<img src="images/i_350.jpg" width="330" height="600" alt="elephants" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">INDIAN ELEPHANTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the various collections of Europe are many specimens of
ivory used by the ancient Egyptians, among the chief of which
may be mentioned an ivory box in the Louvre, having on its lid
the name of the dynasty in which it was carved, and the ivory-tipped
lynch-pins of the splendid war-chariot in Florence, from
which the illustration on page 309 has been drawn.</p>

<p>The ivory used by the Egyptians was, of course, that of the
African Elephant; and was obtained chiefly from Ethiopia, as
we find in Herodotus ("Thalia," 114):&mdash;"Where the meridian declines
towards the setting sun, the Ethiopian territory reaches,
being the extreme part of the habitable world. It produces
much gold, huge elephants, wild trees of all kinds, ebony, and
men of large stature, very handsome and long-lived."</p>

<p>The passages in the Bible in which the Elephant itself is
named are only to be found in the Apocrypha, and in all of them
the Elephant is described as an engine of war. If the reader
will refer to the First Book of the Maccabees, he will find that
the Elephant is mentioned at the very commencement of the
book. "Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus,
he thought to reign over Egypt, that he might have the
dominion of two realms.</p>

<p>"Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude,
with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy."
(i. 16, 17.)</p>

<p>Here we see that the Elephant was considered as a most potent
engine of war, and, as we may perceive by the context, the King
of Egypt was so alarmed by the invading force, that he ran away,
and allowed Antiochus to take possession of the country.</p>

<p>After this, Antiochus Eupator marched against Jerusalem
with a vast army, which is thus described in detail:&mdash;"The
number of his army was one hundred thousand footmen, and
twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty elephants exercised
in battle.</p>

<p>"And to the end that they might provoke the elephants to
fight, they showed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.</p>

<p>"Moreover, they divided the beasts among the armies, and
for every elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with
coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
besides this for every beast were ordained five hundred horsemen
of the best.</p>

<p>"These were ready at every occasion wheresoever the beast
was; and whithersoever the beast went they went also, neither
departed they from him.</p>

<p>"And upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood,
which covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them
with devices; there were also upon every one two and thirty
strong men that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled
him.</p>

<p>"As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set them on this
side and that side at the two fronts of the host, giving them
signs what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst the
ranks." (1 Macc. vi. 30, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>It is evident from this description that, in the opinion of the
writer, the Elephants formed the principal arms of the opposing
force, these animals being prominently mentioned, and the rest
of the army being reckoned as merely subsidiaries of the
terrible beasts. The thirty-two Elephants appear to have taken
such a hold of the narrator's mind, that he evidently looked upon
them in the same light that the ancient Jews regarded chariots
of war, or as at the present day savages regard artillery.
According to his ideas, the thirty-two Elephants constituted the
real army, the hundred thousand infantry and twenty thousand
cavalry being only in attendance upon these animals.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the description of the war Elephant is a
good one, though slightly exaggerated, and is evidently written
by an eye-witness. The mention of the native mahout, or
"Indian that guided him," is characteristic enough, as is the
account of the howdah, or wooden carriage on the back of the
animal.</p>

<p>The number of warriors, however, is evidently exaggerated,
though not to such an extent as the account of Julius Cæsar's
Elephants, which are said to have carried on their backs sixty
soldiers, beside the wooden tower in which they fought. It is
evident that, in the first place, no Elephant could carry a tower
large enough to hold so many fighting men, much less one
which would afford space for them to use their weapons.</p>

<p>A good account of the fighting Elephant is given by Topsel
(p. 157):&mdash;"There were certain officers and guides of the Elephants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
who were called <em>Elephantarchæ</em>, who were the governors
of sixteen Elephants, and they which did institute and teach
them martial discipline were called <em>Elephantagogi</em>.</p>

<p>"The Military Elephant did carry four persons on his bare
back, one fighting on the right hand, another fighting on the
left hand, a third, which stood fighting backwards from the
Elephant's head, and a fourth in the middle of these, holding
the rains, and guiding the Beast to the discretion of the Souldiers,
even as the Pilot in a ship guideth the stem, wherein
was required an equall knowledge and dexterity; for when the
Indian which ruled them said, Strike here on the right hand,
or else on the left, or refrain and stand still, no reasonable man
could yield readier obedience."</p>

<p>This description is really a very accurate as well as spirited
one, and conveys a good idea of the fighting Elephant as it
appeared when brought into action.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, after giving this temperate and really
excellent account of the war Elephant, the writer seems to have
been unable to resist the fascination of his theme, and proceeds
to describe, with great truth and spirit, the mode of fighting
adopted by the animal, intermixed with a considerable amount
of the exaggeration from which the former part of his account
is free.</p>

<p>"They did fasten iron chains, first of all, upon the Elephant
that was to bear ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty men, on either
side two panniers of iron bound underneath their belly, and
upon them the like panniers of wood, hollow, wherein they
placed their men at armes, and covered them over with small
boards (for the trunck of the Elephant was covered with a mail
for defence, and upon that a broadsword two cubits long); this
(as also the wooden Castle, or pannier aforesaid) were fastened
first to the neck and then to the rump of the Elephant.</p>

<p>"Being thus armed, they entered the battle, and they shewed
unto the Beasts, to make them more fierce, wine, liquor made of
Rice, and white cloth, for at the sight of any of these his courage
and rage increaseth above all measure. Then at the sound of
the Trumpet, he beginneth with teeth to strike, tear, beat, spoil,
take up into the air, cast down again, stamp upon men under
feet, overthrow with his trunck, and make way for his riders to
pierce with Spear, Shield, and Sword; so that his horrible voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a><br /><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
his wonderful body, his terrible force, his admirable skill, his
ready and inestimable obedience, and his strange and seldom-seen
shape, produced in a main battel no mean accidents and
overturns."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WAR ELEPHANT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this account there is a curious mixture of truth and
exaggeration. As we have already seen, the number of soldiers
which the animal was supposed to carry is greatly exaggerated,
and it is rather amusing to note how the "towers" in which they
fought are modified into "panniers." Then the method by which
the animal is incited to the combat is partly true, and partly
false. Of course an Elephant is not angered by seeing a piece
of white cloth, or by looking at wine, or a liquor made of rice.</p>

<p>But that the wine, or the "liquor made of rice," <em>i.e.</em> arrack,
was administered to the Elephant before it was brought into the
battle-field, is likely enough. Elephants are wonderfully fond of
strong drink. They can be incited to perform any task within
their powers by a provision of arrack, and when stimulated by
a plentiful supply of their favourite drink they would be in
good fighting condition.</p>

<p>Next we find the writer describing the Elephant as being
furnished with a coating of mail armour on its proboscis, the
end of which was armed with a sword a yard in length. Now
any one who is acquainted with the Elephant will see at once
that such offensive and defensive armour would deprive the
animal of the full use of the proboscis, and would, therefore,
only weaken, and not strengthen, its use in battle. Accordingly
we find that the writer, when describing with perfect
accuracy the mode in which the Elephant fights, utterly omits
all mention of the sword and the mailed proboscis, and describes
the animal, not as striking or thrusting with the sword, but as
overthrowing with the trunk, taking up into the air, and casting
down again&mdash;acts which could only be performed when the
proboscis was unencumbered by armour. The use of weapons
was left to the soldiers that fought upon its back, the principal
object of the huge animal being to trample its way through
the opposing ranks, and to make a way for the soldiers that
followed.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that, before soldiers become familiarized
with the appearance of the Elephant, they might be
pardoned for being panic-struck at the sight of so strange an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
animal. Not only was it formidable for its vast size, and for the
armed men which it carried, but for the obedience which it
rendered to its keeper, and the skill with which it wielded the
strange but powerful weapon with which Nature had armed it.</p>

<p>At first, the very approach of so terrible a foe struck consternation
into the soldiers, who knew of no mode by which
they could oppose the gigantic beast, which came on in its
swift, swinging pace, crushing its way by sheer weight through
the ranks, and striking right and left with its proboscis. No
other method of checking the Elephant, except by self-sacrifice,
could be found; and in 1 Macc. vi. 43-46, we read how
Eleazar, the son of Mattathias, nobly devoted himself for his
country.</p>

<p>"Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that one of the
beasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the rest,
and supposing that the king was upon him,</p>

<p>"Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver his
people, and get him a perpetual name.</p>

<p>"Whereupon he ran upon him courageously, through the
midst of the battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left,
so that they were divided from him on both sides.</p>

<p>"Which done, he crept under the elephant, and thrust him
under, and slew him; whereupon the elephant fell down upon
him, and he died."</p>

<p>I may here mention that the surname of Savaran, or Avaran,
as it ought to be called, signifies one who pierces an animal from
behind, and was given to him after his death, in honour of his
exploit.</p>

<p>At first, then, Elephants were the most formidable engines
of war that could be brought into the battle-field, and the very
sight of these huge beasts, towering above even the helmets
of the cavalry, disheartened the enemy so much that victory
became easy.</p>

<p>After a while, however, when time for reflection had been
allowed, the more intellectual among the soldiers began to think
that, after all, the Elephant was not a mere engine, but a living
animal, and, as such, subject to the infirmities of the lower
animals. So they invented scheme after scheme, by which they
baffled the attacks of these once dreaded foes, and sometimes
even succeeded in driving them back among the ranks of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
own soldiery, so maddened with pain and anger, that they dealt
destruction among the soldiers for whom they were fighting,
and so broke up their order of battle that the foe easily overcame
them.</p>

<p>The vulnerable nature of the proboscis was soon discovered, and
soldiers were armed with very sharp swords, set on long handles,
with which they continually attacked the Elephants' trunks.
Others were mounted on swift horses, dashed past the Elephant,
and hurled their darts before the animal could strike them.
Others, again, were placed in chariots, and armed with very long
and sharply-pointed spears. Several of these chariots would
be driven simultaneously against an Elephant, and sometimes
succeeded in killing the animal. Slingers also were told off
for the express purpose of clearing the "castles," or howdahs,
of the soldiers who fought on the Elephants' backs, and their
especial object was the native mahout, who sat on the animal's
neck.</p>

<p>Sometimes they made way for the Elephant as it pressed
forward, and then closed round it, so as to make it the central
mark, on which converged a hail of javelins, arrows, and stones
on every side, until the huge animal sank beneath its many
wounds. By degrees, therefore, the Elephant was found to be
so uncertain an engine of war, that its use was gradually discontinued,
and finally abandoned altogether.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Elephant which was employed in these wars was the
Indian species, <em>Elephas Indicus</em>, which is thought to be more
susceptible of education than the African Elephant. The latter,
however, has been tamed, and, in the days of Rome's greatest
splendour, was taught to perform a series of tricks that seem
almost incredible. As, however, the Indian species is that with
which we have here to do, I have selected it for the principal
illustrations.</p>

<p>It may be at once distinguished from its African relative by
the comparatively small ears, those of the African Elephant
reaching above the back of the head, and drooping well below
the neck. The shape of the head, too, is different. In the
Indian species, only the males bear tusks, and even many of
them are unarmed. In the African species, however, both sexes
bear tusks, those of the male furnishing the best ivory, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
peculiar creamy colour and beautiful graining, and those of the
female being smaller in size, and producing ivory of a much
inferior quality.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="afric" id="afric"></a>
<img src="images/i_358.jpg" width="400" height="488" alt="afric" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AFRICAN ELEPHANTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Elephant, whether of Asia or Africa,
always lives in herds varying greatly in numbers,
and invariably found in the deepest forests,
or in their near vicinity. Both species are fond
of water, and never wander far from some stream or fountain,
although they can, and do, make tolerably long journeys for the
purpose of obtaining the needful supply of liquid.</p>

<p>They have a curious capability of laying up a store of water in
their interior, somewhat after the fashion of the camel, but also
possess the strange accomplishment of drawing the liquid supply
from their stomachs by means of their trunks, and scattering it in
a shower over their backs to cool their heated bodies.</p>

<p>When drinking, the Elephant inserts the tip of his trunk into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the stream, fills it with water, and then, turning it into his throat,
discharges the contents.</p>

<p>The strangest portion of the Elephant is the trunk, or proboscis.
This wonderful appendage is furnished at its extremity with a finger-like
projection, with which the animal can pluck a single blade
of grass or pick up a small object from the ground.</p>

<p>The value of the proboscis to the Elephant can be estimated
when it is considered that without its aid the animal must soon
starve to death. The short, thick neck and projecting tusks would
entirely prevent it from reaching any of the vegetation upon which
it feeds.</p>

<p>With the trunk, however, the Elephant readily carries its food
to its mouth, and employs the useful member just as if it were a
long and flexible arm.</p>

<p>The Elephant bears a worldwide fame for its capabilities as a
servant and companion of man, and for the extraordinary development
of its intellectual faculties. The Indian or Asiatic Elephant
is the variety that is considered most docile and easy to
train; these are almost invariably taken in a wild state from their
native forests. The Indian hunters usually proceed into the woods
with trained female Elephants. These advance quietly, and by
their blandishments so occupy the attention of any unfortunate
male that they meet that the hunters are enabled to tie his legs
together and fasten him to a tree. His treacherous companions
now leave him to struggle in impotent rage until he is so subdued
by hunger and fatigue that the hunters can drive him home between
two tame elephants. When once captured, he is easily
trained.</p>

<p>The following curious instance of intelligence in an Elephant
is given by a traveller in Ceylon:</p>

<p>"One evening, while riding in the vicinity of Kandy, my horse
showed some excitement at a noise which was heard in the thick
jungle, sounding something like '<em>Urmph! Urmph!</em>' uttered in a
hoarse and dissatisfied tone. A turn in the forest explained the
mystery, by bringing me face to face with a tame working Elephant
unaccompanied by any driver or attendant. He was laboring
painfully with a heavy beam of timber, which he had balanced
across his tusks and was carrying to the village from which I had
come.</p>

<p>"The pathway being narrow, he was compelled to bend his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a><br /><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
to one side to permit the passage of the long piece of wood, and
the exertion and inconvenience combined, led him to utter the
dissatisfied sounds which had frightened my horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 365px;"><a name="swatter" id="swatter"></a>
<img src="images/i_360.jpg" width="365" height="600" alt="swatter" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ELEPHANTS' WATERING-PLACE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"On seeing us halt, the Elephant raised his head, looked at us
for a moment, then dropped the timber, and forced himself backward
among the bushes at the side of the road, so as to leave us
plenty of room to pass.</p>

<p>"My horse still hesitated; the Elephant observed this, and impatiently
crowded himself still deeper in the jungle, repeating his
cry of, '<em>Urmph! Urmph!</em>' but in a voice evidently meant to
encourage us to come on. Still the horse trembled; and, anxious
to observe the conduct of the two sagacious creatures, I forbore
any interference. Again the Elephant wedged himself farther in
among the trees and waited for us to pass him. At last the horse
timidly did so, after which I saw the wise Elephant come out
of the wood, take up the heavy timber upon his tusks, and resume
his route, hoarsely snorting, as before, his discontented remonstrance."</p>

<p>Although so valuable an animal for certain kinds of work, the
Elephant is hardly so effective an assistant as might be supposed.
The working Elephant is always a delicate animal, and requires
watchfulness and care; as a beast of burden he is unsatisfactory,
for, although in the matter of mere strength there is hardly any
weight that could be conveniently placed on him which he could
not carry, it is difficult to pack it without causing abrasions of
the Elephant's skin, which afterwards ulcerate.</p>

<p>His skin is easily chafed by harness, especially in wet weather.
Either during long droughts, or too much moisture, his feet are
also liable to sores which render him useless for months.</p>

<p>In India the Elephant is used more for purposes of state display
or for hunting than for hard labor. It is especially trained for
tiger-hunting, and, as there is a natural dread of the terrible tiger
deeply implanted in almost all Elephants, it is no easy matter to
teach the animal to approach his powerful foe.</p>

<p>A stuffed tiger-skin is employed for this purpose, and is continually
shown to the Elephant until he learns to lose all distrust
of the inanimate object, and to strike it, to crush it with his feet,
or to pierce it with his tusks.</p>

<p>After a while a boy is put inside the tiger-skin, in order to
accustom the Elephant to the sight of the tiger in motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="tigers" id="tigers"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TIGER.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>The last stage in the proceedings is to procure a dead tiger,
and to substitute it for the stuffed skin. Even with all this training,
it most frequently happens that when the Elephant is brought
to face a veritable living tiger the furious bounds, the savage yells,
and gleaming eyes of the beast are so terrifying that he turns tail
and makes a hasty retreat. Hardly one Elephant out of ten will
face an angry tiger. The Elephant, when used in tiger-hunting,
is always guided by a native driver, called a mahout, who sits
astride of the animal's neck and guides its movements by means
of the voice and the use of an iron hook at the end of a short stick.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="reeds" id="reeds"></a>
<img src="images/i_363.jpg" width="400" height="242" alt="reeds" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE TIGER IN THE REEDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The hunters who ride upon the Elephant sit in a kind of box
called a howdah, which is strapped firmly upon the animal's back,
or else merely rests upon a large flat pad furnished with cross-ropes
for maintaining a firm hold. The Elephant generally kneels to
enable the riders to mount, and then rises from the ground with a
peculiar swinging motion that is most discomposing to beginners in
the art.</p>

<p>The chase of the tiger is among the most exciting and favourite
sports in India. When starting on a hunt, a number of hunters
usually assemble, mounted on Elephants trained for the purpose,
and carrying with them a supply of loaded rifles in their howdahs,
or carriages mounted on the Elephants' backs. Thus armed, they
proceed to the spot where a tiger has been seen. The animal is
usually found hidden in the long grass or jungle, which is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
eight or more feet in height; and when roused, it endeavours
to creep away under the grass. The movement of the leaves betrays
him, and he is checked by a rifle-ball aimed at him through the
jungle. Finding that he cannot escape without being seen, he
turns round and springs at the nearest Elephant, endeavouring to
clamber up it and attack the party in the howdah. This is the
most dangerous part of the proceedings, as many Elephants will
turn round and run away, regardless of the efforts of their drivers
to make them face the tiger. Should, however, the Elephant stand
firm, a well-directed ball checks the tiger in his spring; and he
then endeavours to again escape, but a volley of rifle-balls from
the backs of the other Elephants, who by this time have come up,
lays the savage animal prostrate, and in a very short time his skin
decorates the successful marksman's howdah.</p>

<h2>THE CONEY, OR HYRAX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Shaphan of Scripture, and the correct meaning of the word&mdash;Identification
of the Shaphan with the Syrian Hyrax&mdash;Description of the animal&mdash;Its feet,
teeth, and apparent rumination&mdash;Passages in which the Coney is mentioned&mdash;Habits
of the animal&mdash;Its activity and wariness&mdash;The South African Hyrax,
and its mode of life&mdash;Difficulty of procuring it&mdash;Similarity in appearance and
habits of the Syrian species&mdash;Three species of Hyrax known to naturalists.</p></blockquote>


<p>Among the many animals mentioned in the Bible, there is
one which is evidently of some importance in the Jewish code,
inasmuch as it is twice named in the Mosaic law.</p>

<p>That it was also familiar to the Jews is evident from other
references which are made to its habits. This animal is the
Shaphan of the Hebrew language, a word which has very
wrongly been translated in the Authorized Version as Coney,
<em>i.e.</em> Rabbit, the creature in question not being a rabbit, nor even
a rodent. No rabbit has ever been discovered in Palestine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
naturalists have agreed that the true Coney or Rabbit has never
inhabited the Holy Land. There is no doubt that the Shaphan
of the Hebrew Scripture, and the Coney of the Vulgate, was the
<span class="smcap">Syrian Hyrax</span> (<em>Hyrax Syriacus</em>). This little animal is rather
larger than an ordinary rabbit, is not unlike it in appearance,
and has many of its habits. It is clothed with brown fur, it is
very active, it inhabits holes and clefts in rocks, and it has in
the front of its mouth long chisel-shaped teeth, very much like
those of the rabbit. Consequently, it was classed by naturalists
among the rodents for many years, under the name of Rock
Rabbit. Yet, as I have already mentioned, it is not even a
rodent, but belongs to the pachydermatous group of animals, and
occupies an intermediate place between the rhinoceros and the
hippopotamus.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="hyrax" id="hyrax"></a>
<img src="images/i_366.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="hyrax" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HYRAX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If it be examined carefully, the rodent-like teeth will be seen
to resemble exactly the long curved tusks of the hippopotamus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
with their sharp and chisel-edged tips; the little feet, on a
close inspection, are seen to be furnished with a set of tiny
hoofs just like those of the rhinoceros; and there are many other
points in its structure which, to the eye of a naturalist, point
out its true place in nature.</p>

<p>In common with the rodents, and other animals which have
similarly-shaped teeth, the Hyrax, when at rest, is continually
working its jaws from side to side, a movement which it instinctively
performs, in order that the chiselled edges of the upper
and lower teeth may be preserved sharp by continually rubbing
against each other, and that they may not be suffered to grow
too long, and so to deprive the animal of the means whereby it
gains its food. But for this peculiar movement, which looks
very like the action of ruminating, the teeth would grow far
beyond the mouth, as they rapidly deposit dental material in
their bases in order to supply the waste caused at their tips by
the continual friction of the edges against each other.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that an animal which is classed with the
elephant, the rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus, all bare-skinned
animals, should be clothed with a furry coat. The reader may
perhaps remember that the Hyrax does not afford a solitary
instance of this structure, and that, although the elephants of
our day have only a few bristly hairs thinly scattered over the
body, those of former days were clad in a thick and treble coat
of fur and hair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are four passages of Scripture in which the <span class="smcap">Coney</span> is
mentioned&mdash;two in which it is prohibited as food, and two in
which allusion is made to its manner of life. In order to
understand the subject better, we will take them in their order.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Coney occurs in Leviticus xi. 5,
among the list of clean and unclean animals: "The coney,
because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is
unclean unto you." The second is of a like nature, and is to be
found in Deut. xiv. 7: "These ye shall not eat of them that
chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the
camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but
divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you."</p>

<p>The remaining passages, which describe the habits of the
Coney, are as follow. The first alludes to the rock-loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
habits of the animal: "The high hills are a refuge for the wild
goats, and the rocks for the conies." (Ps. civ. 18.) The second
makes a similar mention of the localities which the animal
frequents, and in addition speaks of its wariness, including it
among the "four things which are little upon the earth, but they
are exceedingly wise." The four are the ants, the locusts, the
spiders, and the Conies, which "are but a feeble folk, yet make
they their houses in the rocks."</p>

<p>We will take these passages in their order.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that the Hyrax, a true pachyderm,
does not merely chew the cud, but that the peculiar and
constant movement of its jaws strongly resembles the act of
rumination. The Jews, ignorant as they were of scientific
zoology, would naturally set down the Hyrax as a ruminant, and
would have been likely to eat it, as its flesh is very good. It
must be remembered that two conditions were needful to render
an animal fit to be eaten by a Jew, the one that it must be a
ruminant, and the second that it should have a divided hoof.
Granting, therefore, the presence of the former qualification,
Moses points out the absence of the latter, thereby prohibiting
the animal as effectually as if he had entered into a question of
comparative anatomy, and proved that the Hyrax was incapable
of rumination.</p>

<p>We now come to the habits of the animal.</p>

<p>As we may gather from the passages of Scripture which have
already been mentioned, the Hyrax inhabits rocky places, and
lives in the clefts that are always found in such localities. It is
an exceedingly active creature, leaping from rock to rock with
wonderful rapidity, its little sharp hoofs giving it a firm
hold of the hard and irregular surface of the stony ground.
Even in captivity it retains much of its activity, and flies about
its cage with a rapidity that seems more suitable to a squirrel
than to an animal allied to the rhinoceros and hippopotamus.</p>

<p>There are several species&mdash;perhaps only varieties&mdash;of the
Hyrax, all of them identical in habits, and almost precisely
similar in appearance. The best known of these animals is that
which inhabits Southern Africa (<em>Hyrax Capensis</em>), and which is
familiar to the colonists by its name of Klip-das, or Rock-rabbit.
In situations which suit it, the Hyrax is very plentiful, and is
much hunted by the natives, who esteem its flesh very highly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Small and insignificant as it appears to be, even Europeans
think that to kill the Hyrax is a tolerable test of sportsmanship,
the wariness of the animal being so great that much hunter's
craft is required to approach it.</p>

<p>The following account of the Hyrax has been furnished to me
by Major A. W. Drayson, R.A.:&mdash;"In the Cape Colony, and over
a great portion of Southern Africa, this little creature is found.
It is never, as far as my experience goes, seen in great numbers,
as we find rabbits in England, though the caution of the animal
is such as to enable it to remain safe in districts from which
other animals are soon exterminated.</p>

<p>"As its name implies, it is found among rocks, in the crevices
and holes of which it finds a retreat. When a natural cavity is
not found, the klip-das scratches a hole in the ground under the
rocks, and burrows like a common rabbit. In size it is about
equal to a hare, though it is much shorter in the legs, and has
ears more like those of a rat than a rabbit. Its skin is covered
with fur, thick and woolly, as though intended for a colder
climate than that in which it is usually found; and, when seen
from a distance, it looks nearly black.</p>

<p>"The rock-rabbit is a very watchful creature, and usually
feeds on the summit of any piece of rock near its home, always
choosing one from which it can obtain a good view of the surrounding
country. When it sees an enemy approaching, it
sits rigidly on the rock and watches him without moving, so
that at a little distance it is almost impossible to distinguish
it from the rock on which it sits. When it does move, it darts
quickly out of sight, and disappears into its burrow with a
sudden leap.</p>

<p>"In consequence of its activity and cunning, the rock-rabbit
is seldom killed by white men; and when a hunter does secure
one, it is generally by means of a long shot. The natives usually
watch near its burrow, or noiselessly stalk it.</p>

<p>"I once killed one of these animals by a very long shot
from a rifle, as it was sitting watching us from the top of a large
boulder, at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards or thereabouts.
The Dutch Boers who were with me were delighted at
the sight of it, as they said it was good eating; and so it proved
to be, the flesh being somewhat like that of a hare, though in
our rough field-cookery we could not do justice to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>This short narrative excellently illustrates the character of the
animal, which is classed among the "four things which be exceeding
wise." It is so crafty that no trap or snare ever set
has induced a Hyrax to enter it, and so wary that it is with
difficulty to be killed even with the aid of fire-arms. "No
animal," writes Mr. Tristram, "ever gave us so much trouble to
secure.... The only chance of securing one is to be concealed,
particularly about sunset or before sunrise, on some overhanging
cliff, taking care not to let the shadow be cast below, and then
to wait until the little creatures cautiously peep forth from their
holes. They are said to be common by those who have not
looked for them, but are certainly not abundant in Palestine,
and few writers have ever had more than a single glimpse of one.
I had the good fortune to see one feeding in the gorge of the
Kedron, and then to watch it as it sat at the mouth of its hole,
ruminating, metaphorically if not literally, while waiting for
sunset."</p>

<p>Should the Hyrax manage to catch a glimpse of the enemy, it
utters a shrill cry or squeal, and darts at once to its hole&mdash;an
action which is followed by all its companions as soon as they
hear the warning cry. It is a tolerably prolific animal, rearing
four or five young at a birth, and keeping them in a soft bed of
hay and fur, in which they are almost hidden. If surprised in
its hole and seized, the Hyrax will bite very sharply, its long
chisel-edged teeth inflicting severe wounds on the hand that
attempts to grasp it. But it is of a tolerably docile disposition,
and in a short time learns to know its owner, and to delight in
receiving his caresses.</p>

<p>Three species of Hyrax are known to naturalists. One is the
Klip-das, or Rock-rabbit, of Southern Africa; the second is the
Ashkoko of Abyssinia; and the third is the Syrian Hyrax, or
the Coney of the Bible. The two last species have often been
confounded together, but the Syrian animal may be known
by the oblong pale spot on the middle of its back.</p>

<p>In the concluding part of that wonderful poem which is so
familiar to us as the Book of Job, the Lord is represented as reproving
the murmurs of Job, by showing that he could not even
understand the mysteries of the universe, much less the purposes
of the Creator. By presuming to bring a charge of injustice
against his Maker, he in fact inferred that the accuser was more
competent to govern the world than was the Creator, and thus
laid himself open to the unanswerable irony of the splendid
passages contained in chapters xl. xli., which show that man
cannot even rule the animals, his fellow-creatures, much less
control the destinies of the human race.</p>

<p>The passages with which we are at present concerned are to
be found at the end of the fortieth chapter, and contain a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
powerful description of some animal which is called by the
name of Behemoth. Now this word only occurs once in the
whole of the Scriptures, <em>i.e.</em> in Job xl. 15: "Behold now
behemoth, which I made with thee," &amp;c. Some commentators,
in consequence of the plural termination of the word, which
may be literally translated as "beasts," have thought that it was
a collective term for all the largest beasts of the world, such as
the elephant, the hippopotamus, the wild cattle, and their like.
Others have thought that the elephant was signified by the word
Behemoth; and some later writers, acquainted with palæontology,
have put forward a conjecture that the Behemoth must
have been some extinct pachydermatous animal, like the dinotherium,
in which might be combined many of the qualities of
the elephant and hippopotamus.</p>

<p>It is now, however, agreed by all Biblical scholars and naturalists,
that the hippopotamus, and no other animal, is the creature
which was signified by the word Behemoth, and this interpretation
is followed in the Jewish Bible.</p>

<p>We will now take the whole of the passage, and afterwards
examine it by degrees, comparing the Authorized Version with
the Jewish Bible, and noting at the same time one or two variations
in the rendering of certain phrases. The passage is given
as follows in the Jewish Bible, and may be compared with our
Authorized Version:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Behold now the river-horse, which I have made with thee: he eateth grass like an ox.<br />
<br />
"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his vigour is in the muscles of his body.<br />
<br />
"He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are wrapped together.<br />
<br />
"His bones are pipes of copper; his bones are like bars of iron.<br />
<br />
"He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can alone reach his sword.<br />
<br />
"That the mountains should bring forth food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there.<br />
<br />
"He lieth under wild lotuses, in the covert of the reed, and fens.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>"Wild lotuses cover him with their shadow; willows of the brook compass him about.<br />
<br />
"Behold, should a river overflow, he hasteth not: he feels secure should Jordan burst forth up to his mouth.<br />
<br />
"He taketh it in with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares."<br />
</p>

<p>We will now take this description in detail, and see how far
it applies to the now familiar habits of the hippopotamus. A
little allowance must of course be made for poetical imagery, but
we shall find that in all important details the account of the
Behemoth agrees perfectly with the appearance and habits of
the hippopotamus.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is evident that we may dismiss from our
minds the idea that the Behemoth was an extinct pachyderm.
The whole tenor of the passage shows that it must have been
an animal then existing, and whose habits were familiar to Job
and his friends. Now the date of the Book of Job could not
have been earlier than about 1500 <small>B.C.</small>, and in consequence,
the ideas of a palæozoic animal must be discarded.</p>

<p>We may also dismiss the elephant, inasmuch as it was most
unlikely that Job should have known anything about the
animal, and it is certain that he could not have attained the
familiarity with its appearance and habits which is inferred by
the context. Moreover, it cannot be said of the elephant that
"he eateth grass as an ox." The elephant feeds chiefly on the
leaves of trees, and when he does eat grass, he cannot do so
"like an ox," but plucks it with his proboscis, and then puts the
green tufts into his mouth. So characteristic a gesture as this
would never have passed unnoticed in a description so full of
detail.</p>

<p>That the hippopotamus was known to the ancient Hebrews is
certain. After their sojourn in Egypt they had necessarily
become familiarized with it; and if, as most commentators believe,
the date of the Book of Job be subsequent to the liberation
of the Israelites, there is no difficulty in assuming that Job and
his companions were well acquainted with the animal. Even if
the book be of an earlier date, it is still possible that the hippopotamus
may, in those days, have lived in rivers where it is now
as much extinct as it is in England. Mr. Tristram remarks on
this point: "No hippopotamus is found in Asia, but there is no
reason for asserting that it may not have had an eastern range as
far as Palestine, and wallowed in the Jordan; for its bones are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a><br /><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
found in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of the rivers of Algeria, flowing into the
Mediterranean, when tradition is quite silent as to its former
existence."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="hip" id="hip"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is no doubt that the hippopotamus and the urus were
the two largest animals known to the Jews, and it is probably
on that account that the former received the name of Behemoth.</p>

<p>Assuming, therefore, that the Behemoth is identical with the
hippopotamus, we will proceed with the description.</p>

<p>"He eateth grass like the ox." The word which is here
rendered "grass" is translated in Numb. xi. 5 as "leeks." It
means, something that is green, and is probably used to signify
green herbage of any description. Now it is perfectly true of
the hippopotamus that it eats grass like an ox, or like cattle, as
the passage may be translated. In order to supply its huge
massive body with nourishment, it consumes vast quantities of
food. The mouth is enormously broad and shovel-shaped, so as to
take in a large quantity of food at once; and the gape is so wide,
that when the animal opens its jaws to their full extent it seems to
split its head into two nearly equal portions. This great mobility
of jaw is assisted by the peculiar form of the gape, which takes a
sudden turn upwards, and reaches almost to the eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="jaws" id="jaws"></a>
<img src="images/i_375.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="jaws" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GREAT JAWS OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Just as the mouth is formed to contain a vast quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a><br /><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
food, so the jaws and teeth are made to procure it. From the
front of the lower jaw the incisor teeth project horizontally, no
longer performing the ordinary duties of teeth, but being modified
into tusks, which are in all probability used as levers for
prising up the vegetables on which the animal lives. But the
most singular portion of the jaw is the mode in which the canine
teeth are modified so as to resemble the incisor teeth of rodents,
and to perform a similar office.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="hipp" id="hipp"></a>
<img src="images/i_376.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="hipp" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These teeth are very long, curved, and chisel-edged at their
tips, their shape being preserved by continual attrition, just as
has been mentioned of the hyrax. The material of the teeth is
peculiarly hard, so much so, indeed, that it is in great request for
artificial teeth, the "verniers" of philosophical instruments, and
similar purposes. Consequently, with these teeth the hippopotamus
can cut through the stems of thick and strong herbage as
with shears, and the strength of its jaws is so great that an
angered hippopotamus has been known to bite a man completely
in two, and to crush a canoe to fragments with a single movement
of its enormous jaws.</p>

<p>Keeping this description in our minds, we shall see how true
is the statement in verse 19. This passage is not adequately
rendered in the Authorized Version: the word which is translated
as "sword" also signifies a scythe, and evidently having that
meaning in the text. The passage is best translated thus: "His
Maker hath furnished him with his scythe."</p>

<p>The havoc which such an animal can make among growing
crops may be easily imagined. It is fond of leaving the river,
and forcing its way into cultivated grounds, where it eats vast
quantities of green food, and destroys as much as it eats, by the
trampling of its heavy feet. Owing to the width of the animal,
the feet are placed very far apart, and the consequence is that
the hippopotamus makes a double path, the feet of each side
trampling down the herbage, and causing the track to look like
a double rut, with an elevated ridge between them.</p>

<p>Some little difficulty has been made respecting the passage in
verse 20, "Surely the mountains bring him forth food." Commentators
ignorant of the habits of the hippopotamus, and not
acquainted with the character of the country where it lives, have
thought that the animal only lived in the rivers, and merely
found its food along its banks, or at most upon the marshes at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the river-side. The hippopotamus, say they, is not a dweller on
the mountains, but an inhabitant of the river, and therefore this
passage cannot rightly be applied to the animal.</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, the word <em>harim</em>, which is translated as
"mountains" in the Authorized Version, is rendered as "hills" by
many Hebraists. Moreover, as we know from many passages of
Scripture, the word "mountain" is applied to any elevated spot,
without reference to its height. Such places are very common
along the banks of the Nile, and are employed for the culture of
vegetables, which would not grow properly upon the flat and
marshy lands around them. These spots are very attractive to
the hippopotamus, who likes a change of diet, and thus finds food
upon the mountains. In many parts of Egypt the river runs
through a mountainous country, so that the hills are within a
very short distance of the water, and are easily reached by the
hippopotamus.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="grass" id="grass"></a>
<img src="images/i_378.jpg" width="300" height="220" alt="grass" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HIPPOPOTAMUS EATING GRASS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We will now proceed to the next verse. After mentioning
that the Behemoth can eat grass like an ox, and finds its food
upon the hills, the sacred writer proceeds to show that in its
moments of repose it is an inhabitant of the rivers and marshy
ground: "He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the
reed, and fens.</p>

<p>"The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows
of the brook compass him about."</p>

<p>Here I may remind the reader that the compound Hebrew word
which is rendered in the Authorized Version as "shady trees" is
translated by some persons as "wild lotuses"&mdash;a rendering which
is followed by the editor of the Jewish Bible. Apparently,
however, the Authorized Version gives a more correct meaning
of the term. Judging from a well-known Egyptian painting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
which represents a hunter in the act of harpooning the hippopotamus,
the tall papyrus reeds are the plants that are signified
by this word, which occurs in no other place in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more accurate than this description of the
habits of the animal. I have now before me a number of sketches
by Mr. T. Baines, representing various incidents in the life of the
hippopotamus; and in one or two of them, the little islands that
stud the river, as well as the banks themselves, are thickly
clothed with reeds mixed with papyrus, the whole being exactly
similar to those which are represented in the conventional style
of Egyptian art. These spots are the favourite haunts of the
hippopotamus, which loves to lie under their shadow, its whole
body remaining concealed in the water, and only the eyes, ears,
and nostrils appearing above the surface.</p>

<p>As reference will be made to this painting when we come to
the Leviathan, it will be as well to describe it in detail. In
order that the reader should fully understand it, I have had it
translated, so to speak, from the conventional outline of Egyptian
art into perspective, exactly as has been done with the Assyrian
and Egyptian chariots.</p>

<p>In the foreground is seen the hunter, standing on a boat that
closely resembles the raft-boat which is still in use in several
parts of Africa. It is made of the very light wood called
ambatch, by cutting down the requisite number of trees, laying
them side by side so that their bases form the stern and their
points the bow of the extemporized boat. They are then firmly
lashed together, the pointed ends turned upwards, and the simple
vessel is complete. It is, in fact, nothing more than a raft of
triangular shape, but the wood is so buoyant that it answers
every purpose.</p>

<p>In his hand the hunter grasps the harpoon which he is about
to launch at the hippopotamus. This is evidently the same
weapon which is still employed for that purpose. It consists of
a long shaft, into the end of which a barbed iron point is loosely
inserted. To the iron point is attached one end of a rope, and
to the other end, which is held in the left hand of the harpooner,
a float of ambatch wood is fastened.</p>

<p>When the weapon is thrown, the furious struggles of the
wounded animal disengage the shaft of the harpoon, which is
regained by the hunter; and as it dashes through the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
throwing up spray as it goes, the ambatch float keeps the end of
the rope at the surface, so that it can be seen as soon as the
animal becomes quieter. Sometimes it dives to the bottom, and
remains there as long as its breath can hold out; and when it
comes up to breathe, it only pushes the nostrils out of the water
under the shadow of the reeds, so that but for the float it might
manage to escape.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="hippohunt" id="hippohunt"></a>
<img src="images/i_380.jpg" width="400" height="402" alt="hippohunt" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A HIPPOPOTAMUS HUNT IN EGYPT.<br />

(This picture is taken from an ancient Egyptian painting.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime, guided by the float, the hunter follows the
course of the animal, and, as soon as it comes within reach of
his weapon, drives another spear into it, and so proceeds until
the animal dies from loss of blood. The modern hunters never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
throw a second harpoon unless the one already fixed gives way,
mainly employing a spear to inflict the last wounds. But if we
may judge from this painting, the Egyptian hunter attached a
new rope with every cast of his weapon, and, when the hippopotamus
became weak from its wounds, gathered up the ropes
and came to close quarters.</p>

<p>In the bow of the boat is the hunter's assistant, armed with a
rope made lasso-wise into a noose, which he is throwing over
the head of the hippopotamus, whose attitude and expression
show evidently, in spite of the rudeness of the drawing, the
impotent anger of the weakened animal.</p>

<p>Behind the hippopotamus are the tall and dense reeds and
papyrus under the shelter of which the animal loves to lie, and
on the surface of the water float the beautiful white flowers of
the lotus.</p>

<p>In the Egyptian painting, the artist, in spite of the conventionalities
to which he was bound, has depicted the whole scene
with skill and spirit. The head and open mouth of the hippopotamus
are remarkably fine, and show that the artist who drew
the animal must have seen it when half mad with pain, and
half dead from loss of blood.</p>

<p>The enormous strength of the hippopotamus is shown in
verses 16, 18, the last of which passages requires a little explanation.
Two different words are used here to express the bones of
the animal. The first is derived from a word signifying strength,
and means the "strong bones," <em>i.e.</em> those of the legs. These are
hollow, and are therefore aptly compared to tubes or pipes of
copper. The second term is thought by some Hebraists to refer
to the rib-bones, which are solid, and therefore are not likened
to tubes, but to bars of iron.</p>

<p>The 23d verse has been translated rather variously. The
Authorized Version can be seen by reference to a Bible, and
another translation, that of the Jewish Bible, is given on page
374. A third, and perhaps the best rendering of this passage is
given by the Rev. W. Drake, in Smith's "Dictionary of the Bible:"
"Lo, the river swelleth proudly against him, yet he is not
alarmed; he is securely confident though a Jordan burst forth
against his mouth."</p>

<p>In all probability reference is here made to the annual rising
of the Nile, and the inundations which it causes. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
years, when it rises much above its usual height, the floods
become most disastrous. Whole villages are swept away, and
scarcely a vestige of the mud-built houses is left; the dead
bodies of human beings are seen intermixed with those of cattle,
and the whole country is one scene of desolation. Yet the
almost amphibious hippopotamus cares nothing for the floods,
as long as it can find food, and so, "though the river swelleth
proudly against him," he is not alarmed.</p>

<p>From the use of the word "Jordan" in the same verse, it might
be thought that the river of Palestine was intended. This,
however, is not the case. The word "Jordan" is simply used as a
poetical term for any river, and is derived from a Hebrew
word which signifies "descending quickly."</p>

<p>We now come to the last verse of this noble description: "He
taketh it in with his eyes." These words have also been variously
rendered, some translating them as "He receiveth it (<em>i.e.</em> the
river) up to his eyes." But the translation which seems to suit
the context best is, "Who will take him when in his sight? His
nose pierceth through (<em>i.e.</em> detects) snares." Now, this faculty
of detecting snares is one of the chief characteristics of the
hippopotamus, when it lives near places inhabited by mankind,
who are always doing their best to destroy it. In the first
place, its body gives them an almost unlimited supply of flesh,
the fat is very highly valued for many purposes, the teeth are
sold to the ivory-dealers, and the hide is cut up into whips, or
khoorbashes.</p>

<p>There is now before me a khoorbash, purchased from a native
Egyptian who was beating a servant with it. The whip is
identical with that which was used by the ancient Egyptians in
urging the Israelites to their tasks, and the scene reminded the
traveller so forcibly of the old Scriptural times that he rescued
the unfortunate servant, and purchased the khoorbash, which is
now in my collection.</p>

<p>Not content with hunting the hippopotamus, the natives
contrive various traps, either pitfalls or drop-traps. The former
are simply pits dug in the path of the animal, covered with
sticks and reeds, and having at the bottom a sharp stake on
which the victim is impaled, and so effectually prevented from
escaping or damaging the pit by its struggles.</p>

<p>The drop-trap is a log of wood, weighted with stones, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
having at one end an iron spike, which is sometimes poisoned.
The path which the animal takes is watched, a conveniently
overhanging branch is selected, and from that branch the cruel
spear is suspended, by a catch or trigger, exactly over the centre
of the path. There is no difficulty in finding the precise centre
of the path, owing to the peculiar gait of the animal, which
has already been described. One end of the trigger supports
the spear, and to the other is attached a rope, which is brought
across the path in such a way that when touched it relieves the
spear, which is driven deeply into the animal's back. If well
hung, the spear-blade divides the spine, and the wounded animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
falls on the spot, but, even if it should miss a vital part, the
poison soon does its fatal work.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HIPPOPOTAMUS AND TRAP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In consequence of the continual persecution to which it is
subjected, the hippopotamus becomes exceedingly wary, and,
huge, clumsy, and blundering as it looks, is clever enough to
detect either pitfall or drop-trap that have not been contrived
with especial care. An old and experienced hippopotamus
becomes so wary that he will be suspicious even of a bent twig,
and, rather than venture across it, he will leave the path, force
for himself a roundabout passage, and return to the path beyond
the object that alarmed him.</p>

<p>Mr. T. Baines, to whose sketches I am indebted for the
illustration, told me that the hippopotamus is possessed of
much more intellect than might be expected from a creature
of so dull, clumsy, and unpromising aspect. Apathetic it
generally is, and, as long as it is left unmolested, does not
care to molest even the human beings that intrude upon its
repose.</p>

<p>It likes to lie in the shade of the reeds and rushes, and may
be seen floating in the water, with only the nostrils, the eyes,
and the ears above the surface, these organs being set in a line
along the head, evidently for the purpose of allowing the whole
body to be hidden under water while the three most important
senses are capable of acting.</p>

<p>A canoe-man who knows the habits of the hippopotamus will
fearlessly take his fragile vessel through a herd of the animals,
knowing that, if he only avoids contact with them, they will
not interfere with him. The only danger is, that a hippopotamus
may rise under the canoe, and strike itself against the boat, in
which case the animal is rather apt to consider the intruding
object as an enemy, and to attack it, sometimes crushing the
canoe between its teeth, and mostly upsetting it, and throwing
the crew into the water. In such a case, the men always dive
at once to the bottom of the river, and hold on to some weed or
rock as long as they can exist without breathing. The reason
for this proceeding is, that the hippopotamus always looks for
its enemy upon the surface of the water, and, if the men were
to swim to shore, they would be caught and killed before they
had swum many strokes. But, as it sees nothing but the
damaged canoe, its short-lived anger vanishes, and it sinks again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
into the river, leaving the men at liberty to regain and repair
their vessel.</p>

<p>There is one passage in the description of the Behemoth
which requires a few words of explanation: "He moveth his
tail like a cedar" (v. 17).</p>

<p>Several commentators have imagined that this expression
shows that the Behemoth must have been an animal which had
a very long and powerful tail, and have adduced the passage as a
proof that the crocodile was the animal that was signified by
the Behemoth. Others, again, have shifted the position of the
tail, and, by rendering it as the "proboscis," have identified the
Behemoth with the elephant. There is, however, no necessity
for straining the interpretation, the passage evidently signifying
that the member in question is stiff and inflexible as the cedar-stem.</p>

<h2>THE APE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Monkey tribe rarely mentioned in Scripture&mdash;Why the Ape was introduced
into Palestine&mdash;Solomon's ships, and their cargo of Apes, peacocks, ivory, and
gold&mdash;Various species of Monkey that might have been imported&mdash;Habits of
the Monkey, and reverence in which it is held by the natives&mdash;The Egyptians
and their Baboon worship&mdash;Idols and memorials&mdash;The Wanderoo&mdash;its singular
aspect&mdash;Reasons why it should be introduced into Palestine&mdash;General habits of
the Wanderoo&mdash;Various species of Monkey that may be included in the term
"Kophim."</p></blockquote>


<p>Animals belonging to the monkey tribe are but sparingly
mentioned in Holy Writ. If, as is possible, the Satyr of
Scripture signifies some species of baboon, there are but three
passages either in the Old or New Testament where these
animals are mentioned. In 1 Kings x. 22, and the parallel
passage 2 Chron. ix. 21, the sacred historian makes a passing
allusion to apes as forming part of the valuable cargoes which
were brought by Solomon's fleet to Tharshish, the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
articles being gold, ivory, and peacocks. The remaining passage
occurs in Is. xiii. 21, where the prophet foretells that on the
site of Babylon satyrs shall dance.</p>

<p>The reason for this reticence is simple enough. No monkey
was indigenous to Palestine when the various writers of the
Bible lived, and all their knowledge of such animals must have
been derived either from the description of sailors, or from the
sight of the few specimens that were brought as curiosities from
foreign lands. Such specimens must have been extremely rare
or they would not have been mentioned as adjuncts to the
wealth of Solomon, the wealthiest, as well as the wisest monarch
of his time. To the mass of the people they must have been
practically unknown, and therefore hold but a very inferior place
in the Scriptures, which were addressed to all mankind.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any familiar animal, bird, reptile or insect,
which is not used in some metaphorical sense in the imagery
which pervades the whole of the Scriptures. For example,
the various carnivorous animals, such as the lion, wolf, and
bear, are used as emblems of destruction in various ways; while
the carnivorous birds, such as the eagle and hawk, and the
destructive insects, such as the locust and the caterpillar, are
all similarly employed in strengthening and illustrating the
words of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>But we never find any animal of the monkey tribe mentioned
metaphorically, possibly because any monkeys that were imported
into Palestine must only have been intended as objects of
curiosity, just as the peacocks which accompanied them were
objects of beauty, and the gold and ivory objects of value&mdash;all
being employed in the decoration of the king's palace.</p>

<p>The question that now comes before us is the species of
monkey that is signified by the Hebrew word Kophim. In
modern days, we distinguish this tribe of animals into three
great sections, namely, the apes, the baboons, and the monkey;
and according to this arrangement the ape, being without tails,
must have been either the chimpanzee of Africa, the orang-outan
of Sumatra, or one of the Gibbons. But there is no reason to
imagine that the word Kophim was intended to represent any
one of these animals, and it seems evident that the word was
applied to any species of monkey, whether it had a tail or not.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best method of ascertaining approximately the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
particular species of monkey, is to notice the land from which
the animals came. Accordingly, we find that the ships of
Solomon brought gold, ivory, apes, and peacocks, and that they
evidently brought their cargoes from the same country. Consequently,
the country in question must produce gold, and must be
inhabited by the monkey tribe, by the elephant, and by the
peacock. If the peacock had not been thus casually mentioned,
we should have been at a loss to identify the particular country
to which reference is made; but the mention of that bird shows
that some part of Asia must be signified. It is most probable
that the vessels in question visited both India and Ceylon, although,
owing to the very imperfect geographical knowledge of the period,
it is not possible to assert absolutely that this is the case. In
India, however, and the large island of Ceylon, gold, elephants,
peacocks, and monkeys exist; and therefore we will endeavour
to identify the animals which are mentioned under the general
term Apes, or Kophim.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE RHESUS MONKEY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We are quite safe in suggesting that some of the apes in question
must have belonged to the Macaques, and it is most likely
that one of them was the <span class="smcap">Rhesus Monkey</span>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FEEDING THE MONKEYS IN INDIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This animal is very plentiful in India, and is one of the many
creatures which are held sacred by the natives. Consequently,
it takes up its quarters near human habitations, feeling sure that
it will not be injured, and knowing that plenty of food is at
hand. It is said that in some parts of India the natives always
leave one-tenth of their grain-crops for the monkeys, and thus
the animals content themselves with this offering, and refrain
from devastating the fields, as they would otherwise do. This
story may be true or not. It is certainly possible that in a long
series of years the monkeys of that neighbourhood have come to
look upon their tithe as a matter belonging to the ordinary
course of things; but whether it be true or not, it illustrates the
reverence entertained by the Hindoos for their monkeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>In many places where grain and fruit crops are cultivated, the
monkeys get rather more than their share, plundering without
scruple, and finding no hindrance from the rightful owners, who
dare not drive them away, lest they should injure any of these
sacred beings. However, being of the opinion that no evil
will follow a foreigner's action, they are only too glad to avail
themselves of the assistance of Europeans, who have no scruples
on the subject. Still, although they are pleased to see the
monkeys driven off, and their crops saved, they would rather
lose all their harvest than allow a single monkey to be killed,
and in the earlier years of the Indian colony, several riots took
place between the natives and the English, because the latter
had killed a monkey through ignorance of the reverence in
which it was held.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TROUBLESOME NEIGHBORS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another monkey which may probably have been brought to
Palestine from India is the <span class="smcap">Hoonuman</span>, <span class="smcap">Entellus</span>, or <span class="smcap">Makur</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
which is more reverenced by the Hindoos than any other
species. Its scientific title is <em>Presbytes entellus</em>. In some parts of
India it is worshipped as a form of divinity, and in all it is
reverenced and protected to such an extent that it becomes a
positive nuisance to Europeans who are not influenced by the
same superstitious ideas as those which are so prevalent in
India. Being a very common species, it could easily be
captured, especially if, as is likely to be the case, it was fearless
of man through long immunity from harm. The sailors who
manned Solomon's navy would not trouble themselves about the
sacred character of the monkeys, but would take them without
the least scruple wherever they could be found.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MONKEYS ENTERING A PLANTATION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Hoonuman would also be valued by them on account of
its docility when taken young, and the amusing tricks which it
is fond of displaying in captivity as well as in a state of
freedom. Moreover, it is rather a pretty creature, the general
colour being yellowish, and the face black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SLOTHFUL MONKEYS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Perfectly aware of the impunity with which they are permitted
to act, these monkeys prefer human habitations to the
forests which form the natural home of their race, and crowd
into the villages and temples, the latter being always swarming
with the long-tailed host. As is the case with the Rhesus, the
Hoonuman monkeys are much too fond of helping themselves
from the shops and stalls, and if they can find a convenient roof,
will sit there and watch for the arrival of the most dainty
fruits.</p>

<p>However, the natives, superstitious as they are, and unwilling
to inflict personal injury on a monkey, have no scruple in
making arrangements by which a monkey that trespasses on
forbidden spots will inflict injury on itself. They may not shoot
or wound in any way the monkeys which cluster on their roofs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and the animals are so perfectly aware of the fact, that they
refuse to be driven away by shouts and menacing gestures.
But, they contrive to make the roofs so uncomfortable by covering
them with thorns, that the monkeys are obliged to quit their
points of vantage, and to choose some spot where they can sit
down without fear of hurting themselves.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A PRIVILEGED RACE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>That the Hindoos should pay homage almost divine to a
monkey, does seem equally absurd and contemptible. But,
strange as this superstition may be, and the more strange because
the intellectual powers of the educated Hindoos are peculiarly
subtle and penetrating, it was shared by a greater, a mightier,
and a still more intellectual race, now extinct as a nation. The
ancient Egyptians worshipped the baboon, and ranked it among
the most potent of their deities; and it can but strike us with
wonder when we reflect that a people who could erect buildings
perfectly unique in the history of the world, who held the foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
place in civilization, who perfected arts which we, at a
distance of three thousand years, have only just learned, should
pay divine honours to monkeys, bulls, and snakes. Such,
however, was the case; and we find that the modern Hindoo
shows as great reverence for the identical animals as did the
Egyptian when Pharaoh was king, and Joseph his prime
minister.</p>

<p>It is said by some, that neither the Egyptian of the ancient
times, nor the Hindoo of the present day, actually worshipped
these creatures, but that they reverenced them as external signs
of some attribute of God. Precisely the same remarks have
been made as to the worship of idols, and it is likely enough
that the highly educated among the worshippers did look upon a
serpent merely as an emblem of divine wisdom, a bull as an
image of divine strength, and a monkey as an external memorial
of the promised incarnation of divinity. So with idols, which to
the man of educated and enlarged mind were nothing but visible
symbols employed for the purpose of directing the mind in
worship. But, though this was the case with the educated and
intellectual, the ignorant and uncultivated, who compose the
great mass of a nation, did undoubtedly believe that both the
living animal and the lifeless idol were themselves divine, and
did worship them accordingly.</p>

<p>There is one species of monkey, which is extremely likely
to have been brought to Palestine, and used for the adornment
of a luxurious monarch's palace. This is the <span class="smcap">Wanderoo</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Nil-Bhunder</span> (<em>Silenus veter</em>). The Wanderoo, or Ouanderoo,
as the name is sometimes spelled, is a very conspicuous animal,
on account of the curious mane that covers its neck and head,
and the peculiarly formed tail, which is rather long and tufted,
like that of a baboon, and has caused it to be ranked among
those animals by several writers, under the name of the Lion-tailed
Baboon. That part of the hairy mass which rolls over the
head is nearly black, but as it descends over the shoulders, it
assumes a greyer tinge, and in some specimens is nearly white.
As is the case with many animals, the mane is not noticeable
in the young specimens, but increases in size with age, only reaching
its full dimensions when the animal has attained adult age.
Only in the oldest specimens is the full, white, venerable, wig-like
mane to be seen in perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>In captivity, the general demeanour of this monkey corresponds
with its grave and dignified aspect. It seems to be
more sedate than the ordinary monkeys, to judge from the
specimens which have lived in the Zoological Gardens, and sits
peering with its shiny brown eyes out of the enormous mane,
with as much gravity as if it were really a judge deciding an important
case in law. Not that it will not condescend to the little
tricks and playful sallies for which the monkeys are so celebrated;
but it soon loses the vivacity of youth, and when full-grown,
presents as great a contrast to its former vivacity, as does
a staid full-grown cat sitting by the fire, to the restless, lively,
playful kitten of three months old. During its growth, it can be
taught to go through several amusing performances, but it has
little of the quick, mercurial manner, which is generally found
among the monkey tribe.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WANDEROO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The docility of the Wanderoo often vanishes together with its
youth. The same animal may be gentle, tractable, and teachable
when young, and yet, when a few years have passed over its
head and whitened its mane, may be totally obstinate and dull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives of the country in which the Wanderoo lives,
attribute to it the wisdom which its venerable aspect seems to
imply, much as the ancient Athenians venerated the owl as
the bird of wisdom, and the chosen companion of the learned
Minerva. In many places, the Wanderoo is thought to be a sort
of king among monkeys, and to enjoy the same supremacy
over its maneless kinsfolk, that the king-vulture maintains over
the other vultures which are destitute of the brilliant crest that
marks its rank.</p>

<p>I am induced to believe that the Wanderoo must have been
one of the monkeys which were brought to Solomon, for two
reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is a native both of India and Ceylon, and
therefore might have formed an article of merchandise, together
with the peacock, gold, and ivory. And if, as is extremely probable,
the Tharshish of the Scripture is identical with Ceylon, it
is almost certain that the Wanderoo would have been brought to
Solomon, in order to increase the glories of his palace. Sir
Emerson Tennant points out very forcibly, that in the Tamil
language, the words for apes, ivory, and peacocks, are identical
with the Hebrew names for the same objects, and thus gives a
very strong reason for supposing that Ceylon was the country
from which Solomon's fleet drew its supplies.</p>

<p>Another reason for conjecturing that the Wanderoo would
have been one of the animals sent to grace the palace of
Solomon is this. In the days when that mighty sovereign lived,
as indeed has been the case in all partially civilized countries, the
kings and rulers have felt a pride in collecting together the
rarest objects which they could purchase, giving the preference to
those which were in any way conspicuous, whether for intrinsic
value, for size, for beauty, or for ugliness. Thus, giants, dwarfs,
and deformed persons of either sex, and even idiots, were seen as
regular attendants at royal courts, a custom which extended
even into the modern history of England, the "Fool" being an
indispensable appendage to the train of every person of rank.
Animals from foreign lands were also prized, and value was set
upon them, not only for their variety, but for any external
characteristic which would make them especially conspicuous.</p>

<p>Ordinary sovereigns would make collections of such objects,
simply because they were rare, and in accordance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a><br /><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
general custom; and in importing the "apes" and peacocks
together with the gold and ivory, Solomon but followed the
usual custom. He, however, on whom the gift of wisdom had
been especially bestowed, would have another motive besides
ostentation or curiosity. He was learned in the study of that
science which we now call Natural History. It is, therefore,
extremely probable, that he would not neglect any opportunities
of procuring animals from distant lands, in order that he might
study the products of countries which he had not personally
visited, and it is not likely that so conspicuous an animal as the
Wanderoo would have escaped the notice of those who provided
the cargo for which so wealthy a king could pay, and for which
they would demand a price proportionate to its variety.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 341px;"><a name="bonnet" id="bonnet"></a>
<img src="images/i_398.jpg" width="341" height="600" alt="bonnet" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BONNET MONKEYS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is perhaps no monkey which is so conspicuous among
its kin as the Wanderoo, and certainly no monkey or ape
inhabiting those parts of the world to which the fleet of Solomon
would have access. Its staid, sedate manners, its black body,
lion-like tail, and huge white-edged mane, would distinguish it
so boldly from its kinsfolk, that the sailors would use all their
efforts to capture an animal for which they would be likely to
obtain a high price.</p>

<p>The peculiar and unique character of Solomon affords good
reason for conjecture that, not only were several species of the
monkey tribe included under the general word Kophim, but that
the number of species must have been very great. He wrote
largely of the various productions of the earth, and, to judge
him by ourselves, it is certain that with such magnificent means
at his command, he would have ransacked every country that
his ships could visit, for the purpose of collecting materials for
his works. It is therefore almost certain that under the word
Kophim may be included all the most plentiful species of
monkey which inhabit the countries to which his fleet had
access, and that in his palace were collected together specimens
of each monkey which has here been mentioned, besides many
others of which no special notice need be taken, such as the
Bonnet Monkeys, and other Macaques.</p>

<h2>THE BAT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Bat mentioned always with abhorrence&mdash;Meaning of the Hebrew name&mdash;The
prohibition against eating Bats&mdash;The edible species, their food and mode of
life&mdash;The noisome character of the Bat, and the nature of its dwelling-place&mdash;Its

of Palestine&mdash;Another species of long-tailed Bat captured in the rock caves
where hermits had been buried&mdash;Other species which probably inhabit Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>Among the animals that are forbidden to be eaten by the
Israelites we find the <span class="smcap">Bat</span> prominently mentioned, and in one or
two parts of Scripture the same creature is alluded to with
evident abhorrence. In Isaiah ii. 20, for example, it is prophesied
that when the day of the Lord comes, the worshippers
of idols will try to hide themselves from the presence of the
Lord, and will cast their false gods to the bats and the moles,
both animals being evidently used as emblems of darkness and
ignorance, and associated together for a reason which will be
given when treating of the mole. The Hebrew name of the
Bat is expressive of its nocturnal habits, and literally signifies
some being that flies by night, and it is a notable fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Greek and Latin names for the bat have also a similar derivation.</p>

<p>In Lev. xi. 20, the words, "All fowls that creep, going upon
all four, shall be an abomination unto you," are evidently intended
to apply to the bat, which, as is now well known, is not
a bird with wings, but a mammal with very long toes, and a
well developed membrane between them. Like other mammals,
the Bat crawls, or walks, on all four legs, though the movement
is but a clumsy one, and greatly different from the graceful ease
with which the creature urges its course through the evening air
in search of food.</p>

<p>Perhaps the prohibition to eat so unsightly an animal may
seem almost needless; but it must be remembered that in
several parts of the earth, certain species of Bat are used as
food. These are chiefly the large species, that are called
Kalongs, and which feed almost entirely on fruit, thus being to
their insectivorous relatives what the fruit-loving bear is among
the larger carnivora. These edible Bats have other habits not
shared by the generality of their kin. Some of the species do
not retire to caves and hollow trees for shelter during their hours
of sleep, but suspend themselves by their hind legs from the
topmost branches of the trees whose fruit affords them nourishment.
In this position they have a most singular aspect, looking
much as if they themselves were large bunches of fruit hanging
from the boughs. Thus, they are cleanly animals, and are as
little repulsive as bats can be expected to be.</p>

<p>But the ordinary bats, such as are signified by the "night-fliers"
of the Scriptures, are, when in a state of nature, exceedingly
unpleasant creatures. Almost all animals are infested with
parasitic insects, but the Bat absolutely swarms with them, so
that it is impossible to handle a Bat recently dead without finding
some of them on the hands. Also, the bats are in the habit
of resorting to caverns, clefts in the rocks, deserted ruins, and
similar dark places, wherein they pass the hours of daylight, and
will frequent the same spots for a long series of years. In consequence
of this habit, the spots which they select for their
resting place become inconceivably noisome, and can scarcely be
entered by human beings, so powerful is the odour with which
they are imbued.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when travellers have been exploring the chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>s
of ruined buildings, or have endeavoured to penetrate into the
recesses of rocky caves, they have been repelled by the bats
which had taken up their habitation therein. No sooner does
the light of the torch or lamp shine upon the walls, than the
clusters of bats detach themselves from the spots to which they
had been clinging, and fly to the light like moths to a candle.
No torch can withstand the multitude of wings that come flapping
about it, sounding like the rushing of a strong wind, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
the bats that do not crowd around the light, dash against the
explorers, beating their leathery wings against their faces, and
clinging in numbers to their dress. They would even settle on the
face unless kept off by the hands, and sometimes they force the intruders
to beat a retreat. They do not intend to attack, for they
are quite incapable of doing any real damage; and, in point of
fact, they are much more alarmed than those whom they annoy.
Nocturnal in their habits, they cannot endure the light, which
completely dazzles them, so that they dash about at random, and
fly blindly towards the torches in their endeavours to escape.</p>

</div>

<p>If, then, we keep in mind the habits of the bats, we shall
comprehend that their habitations must be inexpressibly revolting
to human beings, and shall the better understand the force of
the prophecy that the idols shall be cast to the bats and the
moles.</p>

<p>No particular species of Bat seems to be indicated by the
Hebrew word Hatalleph, which is evidently used in a comprehensive
sense, and signifies all and any species of Bat. Until
very lately, the exact species of Bats which inhabit Palestine
were not definitely ascertained, and could only be conjectured.
But, Mr. Tristram, who travelled in the Holy Land for the express
purpose of investigating its physical history, has set this
point at rest, in his invaluable work, "The Land of Israel," to
which frequent reference will be made in the course of the
following pages.</p>

<p>Almost every cavern which he entered was tenanted by bats,
and he procured several species of these repulsive but interesting
animals. While exploring the vast quarries in which the stone
for the Temple was worked beneath the earth, so that no sound
of tool was heard during the building, numbers of bats were disturbed
by the lights, and fluttered over the heads of the
exploring party.</p>

<p>On another occasion, he was exploring a cave near the centre
of Palestine, when he succeeded in procuring some specimens,
and therefore in identifying at least one species. "In climbing
the rocks soon afterwards, to examine a cave, I heard a singular
whining chatter within, and on creeping into its recesses, a stone
thrown up roused from their roosting-places a colony of large bats,
the soft waving flap of whose wings I could hear in the darkness.
How to obtain one I knew not; but on vigorously plying my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
signal whistle, all the party soon gathered to my help. B. suggested
smoking them, so a fire of brushwood was kindled, and
soon two or three rushed out. Two fell to our shot, and I was
delighted to find myself the possessor of a couple of large fox-headed
bats of the genus Pteropus (<em>Xantharpya ægyptiaca</em>), and
extending twenty and a half inches from wing to wing. As none
of the bats of Palestine are yet known, this was a great prize,
and another instance of the extension westward of the Indian
fauna." These Bats belong to the fruit-eating tribe, and are
closely allied to the Flying Foxes of Java, Australia, and
Southern Africa. Therefore, this would be one of the species
commonly used for food, and hence the necessity for the prohibition.
The present species extends over the greater part of
Northern Africa and into parts of Asia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>The same traveller subsequently discovered several more
species of bats. On one occasion, he was exploring some caves,
near the site of the ancient Jericho. On the eastern face of the
cliffs are a number of caves, arranged in regular tiers, and
originally approached by steps cut out of the face of the rock.
These staircases are, however, washed away by time and the
rains, and in consequence the upper tiers were almost inaccessible.
In some of these caves the walls were covered with
brilliant, but mutilated frescoes; and in others, hermits had
lived and died and been buried. Mr. Tristram and his companions
had penetrated to the second tier, and there made a
curious discovery.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CAVE NEAR THE SITE OF ANCIENT JERICHO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"In the roof of this was a small hole, athwart which lay a
stick. After many efforts, we got a string across it, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
hauled up a rope, by which, finding the stick strong enough, we
climbed, and with a short exercise of the chimney-sweeper's art,
we found ourselves in a third tier of cells, similar to the lower
ones, and covered with the undisturbed dust of ages. Behind the
chapel was a dark cave, with an entrance eighteen inches high.
Having lighted our lantern, we crept in on our faces, and found
the place full of human bones and skulls; with dust several inches
deep. We were in an ancient burying-place of the Anchorites,
or hermits of the country, whose custom it was to retire to such
desert and solitary places.</p>

<p>"Their bones lay in undisturbed order, probably as the corpses
had been stretched after death.</p>

<p>"After capturing two or three long-tailed bats, of a species new
to us, which were the only living occupants of the cave, we crept
out, with a feeling of religious awe, from this strange, sepulchral
cavern."</p>

<p>Besides the species of bats that have been described, it is probable
that representatives of several more families of bats inhabit
Palestine.</p>

<h2>THE<br />
LÄMMERGEIER, OR OSSIFRAGE OF SCRIPTURE.</h2>

<blockquote>

of Palestine&mdash;The Lämmergeier, or Ossifrage of Scripture&mdash;Appearance of the
Lämmergeier&mdash;Its flight and mode of feeding&mdash;Nest of the Lämmergeier.</p></blockquote>


<p>It has already been mentioned that even the best Biblical
scholars have found very great difficulties in identifying several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of the animals which are named in Scripture. This difficulty is
greatly increased when we come to the <span class="smcap">Birds</span>, and in many instances
it is absolutely impossible to identify the Hebrew word
with any precise species. In all probability, however, the
nomenclature of the birds is a very loose one, several species
being classed under the same title.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="lammer" id="lammer"></a>
<img src="images/i_411.jpg" width="400" height="424" alt="lammer" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LÄMMERGEIER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Keeping this difficulty in mind, I shall mention all the species
which are likely to have been classed under a single title, giving
a general description of the whole, and a detailed account of the
particular species which seems to answer most closely to the
Hebrew word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Following the arrangement which has been employed in this
work, I shall begin with the bird which has been placed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
zoologists at the head of its class, namely, the <span class="smcap">Lämmergeier</span>, the
bird which may be safely identified with the Ossifrage of
Scripture. The Hebrew word is "Peres," a term which only
occurs twice when signifying a species of bird; namely, in Lev.
xi. 13, and the parallel passage in Deut. xiv. 12. The first of
these passages runs as follows: "These ye shall have in abomination
among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an
abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray." The
corresponding passage in Deuteronomy has precisely the same
signification, though rather differently worded: "These are they
of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the
ospray."</p>

<p>The word <em>peres</em> signifies a breaker; and the Latin term Ossifraga,
or Bone-breaker, is a very good translation of the word.
How it applies to the Lämmergeier we shall presently see.</p>

<p>The Lämmergeier belongs to the vultures, but has much more
the appearance of an eagle than a vulture, the neck being clothed
with feathers, instead of being naked or only covered with
down. It may at once be known by the tuft of long, hair-like
feathers which depends from the beak, and which has gained for
the bird the title of Bearded Vulture. The colour of the
plumage is a mixture of different browns and greys, tawny
below and beautifully pencilled above, a line of pure white running
along the middle of each feather. When young it is nearly
black, and indeed has been treated as a separate species under
the name of Black Vulture.</p>

<p>It is one of the largest of the flying birds, its length often
exceeding four feet, and the expanse of its wings being rather
more than ten feet. In consequence of this great spread of
wing, it looks when flying like a much larger bird than it really
is, and its size has often been variously misstated. Its flight, as
may be imagined from the possession of such wings, is equally
grand and graceful, and it sweeps through the air with great
force, apparently unaccompanied by effort.</p>

<p>The Lämmergeier extends through a very large range of
country, and is found throughout many parts of Europe and
Asia. It is spread over the Holy Land, never congregating
in numbers, like ordinary vultures, but living in pairs, and
scarcely any ravine being uninhabited by at least one pair of
Lämmergeiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>The food of the Lämmergeier is, like that of other vultures,
the flesh of dead animals, though it does not feed quite in the
same manner that they do. When the ordinary vultures have
found a carcase they tear it to pieces, and soon remove all the
flesh. This having been done, the Lämmergeier comes to the
half-picked bones, eats the remaining flesh from them, and
finishes by breaking them and eating the marrow. That a bird
should be able to break a bone as thick and hard as the thigh-bone
of a horse or ox seems rather problematical, but the bird
achieves the feat in a simple and effectual manner.</p>

<p>Seizing the bone in its claws, it rises to an immense height in
the air, and then, balancing itself over some piece of rock, it lets
the bone fall, and sweeps after it with scarce less rapidity than
the bone falls. Should the bone be broken by the fall, the bird
picks the marrow out of the fragments; and should it have
escaped fracture by reason of falling on a soft piece of ground
instead of a hard rock, the bird picks it up, and renews the process
until it has attained its object. It will be seen, therefore,
that the name of Ossifrage, or Bone-breaker, may very properly
be given to this bird.</p>

<p>Not only does it extract the marrow from bones in this
peculiar manner, but it procures other articles of food by employing
precisely the same system. If it sees a tortoise, many
of which reptiles are found in the countries which it inhabits, it
does not waste time and trouble by trying to peck the shell
open, but carries its prey high in the air, drops it on the ground,
and so breaks its shell to pieces. Tortoises are often very hard-shelled
creatures, and the Lämmergeier has been observed to
raise one of them and drop it six or seven times before the
stubborn armour would yield. Snakes, too, are killed in a
similar manner, being seized by the neck, and then dropped from
a height upon rocks or hard ground. The reader may perhaps
be aware that the Hooded Crow of England breaks bones and
the shells of bivalve molluscs in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Tristram suggests, with much probability, that the
"eagle" which mistook the bald head of the poet Æschylus for
a white stone, and killed him by dropping a tortoise upon it, was
in all likelihood a Lämmergeier, the bird being a denizen of the
same country, and the act of tortoise-dropping being its usual
mode of killing those reptiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 342px;"><a name="defence" id="defence"></a>
<img src="images/i_414.jpg" width="342" height="600" alt="defence" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>We now see why the Lämmergeier is furnished with such
enormous wings, and so great a power of flight, these attributes
being needful in order to enable it to lift its prey to a sufficient
height. The air, as we all know, becomes more and more
attenuated in exact proportion to the height above the earth; and
did not the bird possess such great powers of flight, it would
not be able to carry a heavy tortoise into the thinner strata of
air which are found at the height to which it soars.</p>

<p>The instinct of killing its prey by a fall is employed against
other animals besides snakes and tortoises, though exerted in a
somewhat different manner. The bird, as has already been
mentioned, lives among mountain ranges, and it may be seen
floating about them for hours together, watching each inch of
ground in search of prey. Should it see a goat or other inhabitant
of the rocks standing near a precipice, the Lämmergeier
sweeps rapidly upon it, and with a blow of its wing knocks
the animal off the rock into the valley beneath, where it lies
helplessly maimed, even if not killed by the fall.</p>

<p>Even hares and lambs are killed in this manner, and it is from
the havoc which the Lämmergeier makes among the sheep that
it has obtained the name of Lämmergeier, or Lamb-Vulture. So
swift and noiseless is the rush of the bird, that an animal which
has once been marked by its blood-red eye seldom escapes from
the swoop; and even the Alpine hunters, who spend their lives
in pursuit of the chamois, have occasionally been put in great
jeopardy by the sudden attack of a Lämmergeier, the bird having
mistaken their crouching forms for the chamois, and only turned
aside at the last moment.</p>

<p>The reason for employing so remarkable a mode of attack is to
be found in the structure of the feet, which, although belonging
to so large and powerful a bird, are comparatively feeble, and are
unable, like those of the eagle, to grasp the living animal in a
deadly hold, and to drive the sharp talons into its vitals. They
are not well adapted for holding prey, the talons not possessing
the hook-like form or the sharp points which characterise those
of the eagle. The feet, by the way, are feathered down to the
toes. The beak, too, is weak when compared with the rest
of the body, and could not perform its work were not the
object which it tears previously shattered by the fall from a
height.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>The nest of the Lämmergeier is made of sticks and sods, and
is of enormous dimensions. It is almost always placed upon a
lofty cliff, and contains about a wagon-load or so of sticks
rudely interwoven, and supporting a nearly equal amount of sods
and moss.</p>

<p>An allied species lives in Northern Africa, where it is called
by a name which signifies Father Longbeard, in allusion to the
beard-like tufts of the bill.</p>

<h2>THE EGYPTIAN VULTURE, OR GIER-EAGLE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Râchâm or Gier-Eagle identified with the Egyptian Vulture&mdash;Its appearance
on the Egyptian monuments&mdash;The shape, size, and colour of the bird&mdash;Its value
as a scavenger, and its general habits&mdash;The Egyptian Vultures and the griffons&mdash;Its
fondness for the society of man&mdash;Nest of the Egyptian Vulture.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the same list of unclean birds which has already been given,
we find the name of a bird which we can identify without much
difficulty, although there has been some little controversy about
it. This is the so-called Gier-Eagle, which is named with the
cormorant and the pelican as one of the birds which the Jews
are forbidden to eat. The word which is translated as Gier-Eagle
is Râchâm, a name which is almost identical with the Arabic
name of the <span class="smcap">Egyptian Vulture</span>, sometimes called Pharaoh's
Chicken, because it is so often sculptured on the ancient monuments
of Egypt. It is called by the Turks by a name which
signifies White Father, in allusion to the colour of its plumage.</p>

<p>This bird is not a very large one, being about equal to a raven
in size, though its enormously long wings give it an appearance
of much greater size. Its colour is white, with the exception of
the quill feathers of the wings, which are dark-brown. The bill
and the naked face and legs are bright ochreous yellow. It does
not attain this white plumage until its third year, its colour
before reaching adult age being brown, with a grey neck and
dull yellow legs and face.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Vulture, although not large, is a really handsome
bird, the bold contrast of pure white and dark brown
being very conspicuous when it is on the wing. In this plumage
it has never been seen in England, but one or two examples are
known of the Egyptian Vulture being killed in England while
still in its dark-brown clothing.</p>

<p>It inhabits a very wide range of country, being found
throughout all the warmer parts of the Old World. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
it is tolerably plentiful, it is never seen in great numbers, as is
the case with several of the vultures, but is always to be found
in pairs, the male and female never separating, and invariably
being seen close together. In fact, in places where it is common
it is hardly possible to travel more than a mile or two without
seeing a pair of Egyptian Vultures. Should more than two of
these birds be seen together, the spectator may be sure that they
have congregated over some food. It has been well suggested
that its Hebrew name of Râchâm, or Love, has been given to it
in consequence of this constant association of the male and
female.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="gier" id="gier"></a>
<img src="images/i_419.jpg" width="400" height="405" alt="gier" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">EGYPTIAN VULTURE, OR GIER-EAGLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Egyptian Vulture is one of the best of scavengers, not
only devouring the carcases of dead animals, but feeding on
every kind of offal or garbage. Indeed, its teeth and claws are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
much too feeble to enable it to cope with the true vultures in
tearing up a large carcase, and in consequence it never really
associates with them, although it may be seen hovering near
them, and it never ventures to feed in their company, keeping
at a respectful distance while they feed, and, when they retire,
humbly making a meal on the scraps which they have left.</p>

<p>Mr. Tristram narrates an amusing instance of this trait of
character. "On a subsequent occasion, on the north side of
Hermon, we observed the griffons teaching a lesson of patience
to the inferior scavengers. A long row of Egyptian vultures
were sitting on some rocks, so intently watching a spot in a
corn-field that they took no notice of our approach. Creeping
cautiously near, we watched a score of griffons busily engaged
in turning over a dead horse, one side of which they had already
reduced to a skeleton.</p>

<p>"Their united efforts had just effected this, when we showed
ourselves, and they quickly retired. The inferior birds, who
dreaded us much less than them, at once darted to the repast,
and, utterly regardless of our presence within ten yards of them,
began to gorge. We had hardly retired two hundred yards, when
the griffons came down with a swoop, and the Egyptian vultures
and a pair or two of eagles hurriedly resumed their post of
observation; while some black kites remained, and contrived by
their superior agility to filch a few morsels from their lordly
superiors."</p>

<p>So useful is this bird as a scavenger, that it is protected in all
parts of the East by the most stringent laws, so that a naturalist
who wishes for specimens has some difficulty in procuring the
bird, or even its egg. It wanders about the streets of the villages,
and may generally be found investigating the heaps of refuse
which are left to be cleared away by the animals and birds
which constitute the scavengers of the East.</p>

<p>It not only eats dead animal substances, but kills and devours
great quantities of rats, mice, lizards, and other pests that swarm
in hot countries. So tame is it, that it may even be observed,
like the gull and the rook of our own country, following the
ploughman as he turns up the ground, and examining the furrow
for the purpose of picking up the worms, grubs, and similar
creatures that are disturbed by the share.</p>

<p>Being thus protected and encouraged by man, there is good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
reason why it should have learned in course of time to fear him
far less than its own kind. Indeed, it is so utterly fearless with
regard to human beings, that it habitually follows the caravans
as they pass from one town to another, for the sake of feeding
on the refuse food and other offal which is thrown aside on
the road.</p>

<p>Two articles of diet which certainly do not seem to fall within
the ordinary range of vulture's food are said to be consumed
by this bird. The first is the egg of the ostrich, the shell
of which is too hard to be broken by the feeble beak of the
Egyptian Vulture. The bird cannot, like the lämmergeier,
carry the egg into the air and drop it on the ground, because its
feet are not large enough to grasp it, and only slip off its round
and polished surface. Therefore, instead of raising the egg into
the air and dropping it upon a stone, it carries a stone into the
air and drops it upon the egg. So at least say the natives of the
country which it inhabits, and there is no reason why we should
doubt the truth of the statement.</p>

<p>The other article of food is a sort of melon, very full of juice.
This melon is called "nara," and is devoured by various creatures,
such as lions, leopards, mice, ostriches, &amp;c. and seems to serve
them instead of drink.</p>

<p>The nest of the Egyptian Vulture is made in some rocky
ledge, and the bird does not trouble itself about selecting a spot
inaccessible to man, knowing well that it will not be disturbed.
The nest is, like that of other vultures, a large and rude mass
of sticks, sods, bones, and similar materials, to which are added
any bits of rag, rope, skin, and other village refuse which it can
pick up as it traverses the streets. There are two, and occasionally
three, eggs, rather variously mottled with red. In
its breeding, as in its general life, it is not a gregarious bird,
never breeding in colonies, and, indeed, very seldom choosing
a spot for its nest near one which has already been selected
by another pair.</p>

<p>The illustration on page 420 represents part of the nest of
the Egyptian Vulture, in which the curious mixture of bones
and sticks is well shown. The parent birds are drawn in
two characteristic attitudes taken from life, and well exhibit
the feeble beak, the peculiar and intelligent, almost cunning
expression of the head, and the ruff of feathers which surrounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the upper part of the neck. In the distance another bird is drawn
as it appears on the wing, in order to show the contrast between
the white plumage and the dark quill feathers of the wings, the
bird presenting a general appearance very similar to that of the
common sea-gull.</p>

<p>The Griffon Vulture is found throughout a large portion of
the Old World, inhabiting nearly all the warmer portions of this
hemisphere. The colour of the adult bird is a sort of yellowish
brown, diversified by the black quill feathers and the ruff of
white down that surrounds the neck. The head and neck are
without feathers, but are sparingly covered with very short down
of a similar character to that of the ruff.</p>

<p>It is really a large bird, being little short of five feet in total
length, and the expanse of wing measuring about eight feet.</p>

<p>The Griffon Vulture is very plentiful in Palestine, and, unlike
the lesser though equally useful Egyptian Vulture, congregates
together in great numbers, feeding, flying, and herding in
company. Large flocks of them may be seen daily, soaring high
in the air, and sweeping their graceful way in the grand curves
which distinguish the flight of the large birds of prey. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
are best to be seen in the early morning, being in the habit of
quitting their rocky homes at daybreak, and indulging in a flight
for two or three hours, after which they mostly return to the
rocks, and wait until evening, when they take another short
flight before retiring to rest.</p>

<p>Allusion is made in the Scriptures to the gregarious habits
of the Vultures: "Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the
eagles be gathered together" (Matt. xxiv. 28). That the Vulture,
and not the eagle, is here signified, is evident from the fact that
the eagles do not congregate like the Vultures, never being seen
in greater numbers than two or three together, while the Vultures
assemble in hundreds.</p>

<p>There is also a curious passage in the Book of Proverbs, chap.
xxx. ver. 17, which alludes to the carnivorous nature of the bird:
"The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young
eagles shall eat it."</p>

<p>Allusion is made in several passages to the swiftness of the
Vulture, as well as its voracity. See, for example, a portion of
David's lamentation over the bodies of Saul and Jonathan, who,
according to the poet's metaphor, "were lovely and pleasant in
their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were
swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions."</p>

<p>The "bitter" people&mdash;namely, the Chaldeans&mdash;are again mentioned
in a very similar manner by the prophet Jeremiah: "Our
persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they
pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness" (Lam. iv. 19).</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly appropriate in employing the
Vulture as an image of strength and swiftness when applied to
warriors, the bird being an invariable attendant on the battle,
and flying to the field of death with marvellous swiftness. All
who had ever witnessed a battle were familiar with the presence
of the Vulture&mdash;the scene of carnage, and the image which is
employed, would be one which commended itself at once to
those for whom it was intended. And, as the earlier history of
the Jewish nation is essentially of a warlike character, we
cannot wonder that so powerful and familiar an image should
have been repeatedly introduced into the sacred writings.</p>

<p>Wonderful powers of sight are possessed by this bird. Its eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a><br /><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
are able to assume either a telescopic or a microscopic character,
by means of a complex and marvellous structure, which can
alter the whole shape of the organ at the will of the bird.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="vult" id="vult"></a>
<img src="images/i_424.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="vult" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">VULTURES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Not only can the eye be thus altered, but it changes instantaneously,
so as to accommodate itself to the task which it is to
perform. A Vulture, for example, sees from a vast height the
body of a dead animal, and instantly swoops down upon it like
an arrow from a bow. In order to enable the bird to see so
distant an object, the eye has been exercising its telescopic
powers, and yet, in a second or two, when the Vulture is close
to its prey, the whole form of the eye must be changed, or
the bird would mistake its distance, and dash itself to pieces
on the ground.</p>

<p>By means of its powerful eyes, the Vulture can see to an
enormous distance, and with great clearness, but neither so far
nor so clearly as is popularly supposed. It is true that, as soon
as a carcase is discovered, it will be covered with Vultures, who
arrive from every side, looking at first like tiny specks in the air,
scarcely perceptible even to practised eyes, and all directing
their flight to the same point. "Where the carcase is, there
will the vultures be gathered together." But, although they all
fly towards the same spot, it does not follow that they have all
seen the same object. The fact is, they see and understand each
other's movements.</p>

<p>A single Vulture, for example, sees a dead or dying sheep, and
swoops down upon it. The other Vultures which are flying
about in search of food, and from which the animal in question
may be concealed, know perfectly well that a Vulture soars high
in the air when searching for food, and only darts to the earth
when it has found a suitable prey. They immediately follow its
example, and in their turn are followed by other Vultures, which
can see their fellows from a distance, and know perfectly well
why they are all converging to one spot.</p>

<p>In this way all the Vultures of a neighbourhood will understand,
by a very intelligible telegraph, that a dead body of some
animal has been found, and, aided by their wonderful powers of
flight, will assemble over its body in an almost incredibly short
space of time.</p>

<p>The resting-place of the Griffon Vulture is always on some
lofty spot. The Arabian Vulture will build within easy reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the eagle prefers lofty situations, but nothing but the highest
and most inaccessible spots will satisfy the Vulture. To reach
the nest of this bird is therefore a very difficult task, only to
be attempted by experienced and intrepid cragsmen; and, in
consequence, both the eggs and young of the Griffon Vulture
cannot be obtained except for a very high price. The birds are
fond of building in the rock-caves which are found in so many
parts of Palestine, and in some places they fill these places as
thickly as rooks fill a rookery.</p>

<p>In Mr. Tristram's "Land of Israel," there is a very graphic
description of the Griffon's nests, and of the difficulty experienced
in reaching them. "A narrow gorge, with limestone cliffs
from five hundred to six hundred feet high, into which the sun
never penetrates, walls the rapid brook on each side so closely
that we often had to ride in the bed of the stream. The cliffs
are perforated with caves at all heights, wholly inaccessible to
man, the secure resting-place of hundreds of noble griffons, some
lämmergeiers, lanner falcons, and several species of eagle....
One day in the ravine well repaid us, though so terrific were
the precipices, that it was quite impossible to reach any of the
nests with which it swarmed.</p>

<p>"We were more successful in the Wady Hamâm, the south-west
end of the plain, the entrance from Hattin and the Buttauf,
where we spent three days in exploration. The cliffs, though
reaching the height of fifteen hundred feet, rise like terraces,
with enormous masses of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>, and the wood is half a mile
wide. By the aid of Giacomo, who proved himself an expert
rope-climber, we reaped a good harvest of griffons' eggs, some
of the party being let down by ropes, while those above were
guided in working them by signals from others below in the
valley. It required the aid of a party of a dozen to capture
these nests. The idea of scaling the cliff with ropes was quite
new to some Arabs who were herding cattle above, and who
could not, excepting one little girl, be induced to render any
assistance. She proved herself most sensible and efficient in
telegraphing.</p>

<p>"While capturing the griffons' nests, we were re-enacting a
celebrated siege in Jewish history. Close to us, at the head of
the cliffs which form the limits of the celebrated Plain of
Hattin, were the ruins of Irbid, the ancient Arbela, marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
principally by the remains of a synagogue, of which some
marble shafts and fragments of entablature, like those of Tell
Hûm, are still to be seen, and were afterwards visited by us.</p>

<p>"Hosea mentions the place apparently as a strong fortress:
'All thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel
in the day of battle' (Hos. x. 14). Perhaps the prophet
here refers to the refuges in the rocks below.</p>

<p>"The long series of chambers and galleries in the face of the
precipice are called by the Arabs, Kulat Ibn Maân, and are
very fully described by Josephus. These cliffs were the homes
of a set of bandits, who resided here with their families, and for
years set the power of Herod the Great at defiance. At length,
when all other attempts at scaling the fortress had failed, he let
down soldiers at this very spot in boxes, by chains, who attacked
the robbers with long hooks, and succeeded in rooting them all
out.</p>

<p>"The rock galleries, though now only tenanted by griffons,
are very complete and perfect, and beautifully built. Long
galleries wind backwards and forwards in the cliff side, their
walls being built with dressed stone, flush with the precipice,
and often opening into spacious chambers. Tier after tier rise
one after another with projecting windows, connected by narrow
staircases, carried sometimes upon arches, and in the upper
portions rarely broken away. In many of the upper chambers
to which we were let down, the dust of ages had accumulated,
undisturbed by any foot save that of the birds of the air; and
here we rested during the heat of the day, with the plains and
lake set as in a frame before us. We obtained a full zoological
harvest, as in three days we captured fourteen nests of
griffons."</p>

<p>Although these caverns and rocky passages are much more
accessible than most of the places whereon the Griffons build,
the natives never venture to enter them, being deterred not so
much by their height, as by their superstitious fears. The
Griffons instinctively found out that man never entered these
caverns, and so took possession of them.</p>

<p>As the young Griffons are brought up in these lofty and precipitous
places, it is evident that their first flight must be a
dangerous experiment, requiring the aid of the parent birds.
At first the young are rather nervous at the task which lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
before them, and shrink from trusting themselves to the air.
The parents, however, encourage them to use their wings, take
short flights in order to set them an example, and, when they at
last venture from the nest, accompany and encourage them in
their first journey.</p>

<p>In flight it is one of the most magnificent birds that can be
seen, and even when perched it often retains a certain look of
majesty and grandeur. Sometimes, however, especially when
basking in the sun, it assumes a series of attitudes which are
absolutely grotesque, and convert the noble-looking bird into a
positively ludicrous object. At one moment it will sit all
hunched up, its head sunk between its shoulders, and one wing
trailing behind it as if broken. At another it will bend its legs
and sit down on the ankle-joint, pushing its feet out in front, and
supporting itself by the stiff feathers of its tail. Often it will
touch nearly flat on the ground, partly spread its wings, and
allow their tips to rest on the earth, and sometimes it will support
nearly all the weight of its body on the wings, which rest,
in a half doubled state, on the ground. I have before me a great
number of sketches, taken in a single day, of the attitudes
assumed by one of these birds, every one of which is strikingly
different from the others, and transforms the whole shape of
the bird so much that it is scarcely recognisable as the same
individual.</p>

<h2>THE EAGLE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Signification of the word <em>Asniyeh</em>&mdash;The Golden Eagle and its habits&mdash;The Imperial
Eagle&mdash;Its solitary mode of life&mdash;The Short-toed Eagle&mdash;Its domestic habits
and fondness for the society of man&mdash;The Osprey, or Fishing Eagle&mdash;Its mode
of catching fish&mdash;Its distribution in Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>As to the Eagle, rightly so called, there is little doubt that it is
one of the many birds of prey that seem to have been classed
under the general title of Asniyeh&mdash;the word which in the
Authorized Version of the Bible is rendered as Osprey. A
similar confusion is observable in the modern Arabic, one word,
<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">ogab</i>, being applied indiscriminately to all the Eagles and the
large <em>falconidæ</em>.</p>

<p>The chief of the true Eagles, namely, the Golden Eagle
(<em>Aquila chrysaëtos</em>), is one of the inhabitants of Palestine, and
is seen frequently, though never in great numbers. Indeed, its
predacious habits unfit it for associating with its kind. Any
animal which lives chiefly, if not wholly, by the chase, requires
a large district in order to enable it to live, and thus twenty
or thirty eagles will be scattered over a district of twice the
number of miles. Like the lion among the mammalia, the
Eagle leads an almost solitary life, scarcely ever associating with
any of its kind except its mate and its young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of the Falconidæ, as the family to which the Eagles
belong is called, are very destructive birds, gaining their subsistence
chiefly by the chase, seldom feeding on carrion except when
pressed by hunger, or when the dead animal has only recently
been killed.</p>

<p>Herein they form a complete contrast to the vultures, whose
usual food is putrefying carrion, and fresh meat the exception.</p>

<p>Destructive though the Eagles may be, they cannot be called
cruel birds, for, although they deprive many birds and beasts of
life, they effect their purpose with a single blow, sweeping down
upon the doomed creature with such lightning velocity, and striking
it so fiercely with their death-dealing talons, that almost instantaneous
death usually results.</p>

<p>When the Eagle pounces on a bird, the mere shock caused by
the stroke of the Eagle's body is almost invariably sufficient to
cause death, and the bird, even if a large one&mdash;such as the swan,
for example&mdash;falls dead upon the earth with scarcely a wound.</p>

<p>Smaller birds are carried off in the talons of their pursuers, and
are killed by the grip of their tremendous claws, the Eagle in no
case making use of its beak for killing its prey. If the great bird
carries off a lamb or a hare, it grasps the body firmly with its
claws, and then by a sudden exertion of its wonderful strength
drives the sharp talons deep into the vitals of its prey, and does
not loosen its grasp until the breath of life has fled from its
victim.</p>

<p>The structure by means of which the Eagle is enabled to use
its talons with such terrible effect is equally beautiful and simple,
deserving special mention.</p>

<p>Now, many observant persons have been struck with the curious
power possessed by birds which enables them to hold their position
upon a branch or perch even while sleeping. In many instances
the slumbering bird retains its hold of the perch by a single foot,
the other being drawn up and buried in the feathers.</p>

<p>As this grasp is clearly an involuntary one, it is evidently independent
of the mere will of the bird, and is due to some peculiar
formation.</p>

<p>On removing the skin from the leg of any bird, and separating
the muscles from each other, the structure in question is easily seen.
The muscles which move the leg and foot, and the tendons, or
leaders which form the attachment of the muscles to the bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
are so arranged that whenever the bird bends its leg the foot is
forcibly closed, and is opened again when the leg is straightened.</p>

<p>A common chicken, as it walks along, closing its toes as it lifts
its foot from the ground and spreading them as the leg is unbent,
cannot do otherwise, as the tendons are shortened and lengthened
as each step is taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="eagles" id="eagles"></a>
<img src="images/i_431.jpg" width="400" height="545" alt="eagles" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">EAGLES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that when a bird falls asleep upon a
branch the legs are not only bent, but are pressed downwards by
the weight of the body; so that the claws hold the perch with a
firm and involuntary grasp which knows no fatigue, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
remains secure as long as the pressure from above keeps the limbs
bent.</p>

<p>To return to the Eagle. When, therefore, the bird desires to
drive his talons into the body of his prey, he needs only to sink
downwards with his whole weight, and the forcible bending of his
legs will contract the talons with irresistible force, without the
necessity of any muscular exertion.</p>

<p>Exertion, indeed, is never needlessly used by the Eagle, for it
is very chary of putting forth its great muscular powers, and unless
roused by the sight of prey, or pressed to fly abroad in search of
food, will sit upon a tree or point of rock for hours as motionless
as a stuffed figure.</p>

<p>The Golden Eagle is a truly magnificent bird in size and appearance.
A full-grown female measures about three feet six inches in
length, and the expanse of her wings is nine feet. The male bird
is smaller by nearly six inches. The colour of the bird is a rich
blackish brown on the greater part of the body, the head and neck
being covered with feathers of a golden red, which have earned for
the bird its customary name.</p>

<p>The Golden Eagle is observed to frequent certain favourite places,
and to breed regularly in the same spot, for a long series of years.
The nest is always made upon some high place, generally upon a
ledge of rock, and is most roughly constructed of sticks.</p>

<p>In hunting for their prey the Eagle and his mate assist each
other. It may be also mentioned here that Eagles keep themselves
to a single mate, and live together throughout their lives. Should,
however, one of them die or be killed, the survivor does not long
remain in a state of loneliness, but vanishes from the spot for a
longer or shorter time, and then returns with a new mate.</p>

<p>As rabbits and hares, which form a frequent meal for the Eagle,
are usually hidden under bushes and trees during the day, the
birds are frequently forced to drive them from their place of concealment;
this they have been observed to do in a very clever
manner. One of the Eagles conceals itself near the cover, and
its companion dashes among the bushes, screaming and making
such a disturbance that the terrified inmates rush out in hopes of
escape, and are immediately pounced upon by the watchful confederate.</p>

<p>The prey is immediately taken to the nest, and distributed to
the young after being torn to pieces by the parent birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>Four or five species of Eagle are known to inhabit Palestine.
There is, for example, the Imperial Eagle (<em>Aquila mogilnik</em>),
which may be distinguished from the Golden Eagle by a white
patch on the shoulders, and the long, lancet-shaped feathers of
the head and neck. These feathers are of a fawn colour, and
contrast beautifully with the deep black-brown of the back and
wings. It is not very often seen, being a bird that loves the
forest, and that does not care to leave the shelter of the trees.
It is tolerably common in Palestine.</p>

<p>Then there are several of the allied species, of which the best
example is perhaps the Short-toed Eagle (<em>Circaëtus cinereus</em>), a
bird which is extremely plentiful in the Holy Land&mdash;so plentiful
indeed that, as Mr. Tristram remarks, there are probably twice
as many of the Short-toed Eagles in Palestine as of all the other
species put together. The genus to which this bird belongs does
not take rank with the true Eagles, but is supposed by systematic
naturalists to hold an intermediate place between the
true Eagles and the ospreys.</p>

<p>The Short-toed Eagle is seldom a carrion-eater, preferring to
kill its prey for itself. It feeds mostly on serpents and other
reptiles, and is especially fond of frogs. It is a large and somewhat
heavily built bird, lightness and swiftness being far less
necessary than strength in taking the animals on which it feeds.
It is rather more than two feet in length, and is a decidedly
handsome bird, the back being dark brown, and the under parts
white, covered with crescent-shaped black spots.</p>

<h2>THE OSPREY.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Osprey, or Fishing Eagle&mdash;Its geographical range&mdash;Mode of securing prey&mdash;Structure
of its feet&mdash;Its power of balancing itself in the air.</p></blockquote>


<p>We now come to the Osprey itself (<em>Pandion haliaëtus</em>), which
was undoubtedly one of the birds grouped together under the
collective term Asniyeh. This word occurs only in the two
passages in Deut. xiv. and Lev. xi. which have been several
times quoted already, and need not be mentioned again.</p>

<p>This fine bird is spread over a very large range of country, and
is found in the New World as well as the Old. In consequence
of its peculiar habits, it is often called the Fishing Eagle.</p>

<p>The Osprey is essentially a fish-eater. It seems very strange
that a predacious bird allied to the eagles, none of which birds
can swim, much less dive, should obtain its living from the
water. That the cormorant and other diving birds should do so
is no matter of surprise, inasmuch as they are able to pursue the
fish in their own element, and catch them by superior speed.
But any bird which cannot dive, and which yet lives on fish, is
forced to content itself with those fish that come to the surface
of the water, a mode of obtaining a livelihood which does not
appear to have much chance of success. Yet the Osprey does on
a large scale what the kingfisher does on a small one, and contrives
to find abundant food in the water.</p>

<p>Its method of taking prey is almost exactly like that which is
employed by the kingfisher. When it goes out in search of
food, it soars into the air, and floats in circles over the water,
watching every inch of it as narrowly as a kestrel watches a
stubble-field. No sooner does a fish rise toward the surface to
take a fly, or to leap into the air for sport, than the Osprey darts
downwards, grasps the fish in its talons, drags the struggling
prey from the water, and with a scream of joy and triumph
bears it away to shore, where it can be devoured at leisure.</p>

<p>The bird never dives, neither does it seize the fish with its beak
like the kingfisher. It plunges but slightly into the water, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a><br /><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
otherwise it would not be able to use its strong wings and carry
off its prey. In order to enable the bird to seize the hard and
slippery body of the fish, it is furnished with long, very sharp,
and boldly-hooked talons, which force themselves into the sides
of the fish, and hold it as with grappling irons.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 330px;"><a name="osprey" id="osprey"></a>
<img src="images/i_436.jpg" width="330" height="600" alt="osprey" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE OSPREY SEARCHING FOR FISH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The flight of the Osprey is peculiarly easy and elegant, as might
be expected from a bird the length of whose body is only twenty-two
inches, and the expanse of wing nearly five feet and a half.</p>

<p>It is therefore able to hover over the water for long periods of
time, and can balance itself in one spot without seeming to move
a wing, having the singular facility of doing so even when a
tolerably strong breeze is blowing. It has even been observed
to maintain its place unmoved when a sharp squall swept over
the spot.</p>

<p>Harmless though the Osprey be&mdash;except to the fish&mdash;it is a most
persecuted bird, being everywhere annoyed by rooks and crows,
and, in America, robbed by the more powerful white-headed eagle.</p>

<p>Such a scene is thus described by Wilson:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Elevated on the high, dead limb of a gigantic tree that commanded
a wide view of the neighbouring shore and ocean, the
great white-headed eagle calmly surveys the motions of various
smaller birds that pursue their busy avocations below.</p>

<p>"The snow-white gulls slowly winnowing the air; the trains of
ducks streaming over the surface; silent and watchful cranes,
intent and wading, and all the winged multitude that subsist by
the bounty of this vast liquid magazine of nature.</p>

<p>"High over all these, hovers one whose action instantly arrests
the eagle's attention. By his wide curvature of wing and sudden
suspension in the air he knows him to be the Osprey, settling over
some devoted victim of the deep. The eyes of the eagle kindle at
the sight, and balancing himself with half-opened wings on the
branch, he watches the result.</p>

<p>"Down, rapid as an arrow, from heaven descends the Osprey,
the roar of its wings reaching the ear as it disappears in the water,
making the surges foam around! At this moment the eager looks
of the eagle are all ardour, and, levelling his neck for flight, he
sees the Osprey once more emerge, struggling with his prey, and
mounting in the air with screams of exultation.</p>

<p>"These are the signals for the eagle, who, launching into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a><br /><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
air, instantly gives chase, and soon gains on the Osprey; each
exerts his utmost to mount above the other, displaying in this
encounter the most elegant and sublime aërial evolutions.</p>

<p>"The unencumbered eagle rapidly advances, and is just on the
point of reaching his opponent, when, with a sudden scream, probably
of despair and honest execration, the Osprey drops his fish.</p>

<p>"The eagle, poising himself for a moment, as if to take a more
certain aim, descends like a whirlwind, snatches it in his grasp ere
it reaches the water, and bears his ill-gotten booty silently away to
the woods."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although not very plentiful in Palestine, nor indeed in any
other country, the Osprey is seen throughout the whole of that
country where it can find a sufficiency of water. It prefers the
sea-shore and the rivers of the coast, and is said to avoid the Sea
of Galilee.</p>

<h2>THE KITE, OR VULTURE OF SCRIPTURE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The word <em>Dayah</em> and its signification&mdash;Dayah a collective term for different
species of Kites&mdash;The Common or Red Kite plentiful in Palestine&mdash;Its piercing
sight and habit of soaring&mdash;The Black Kite of Palestine and its habits&mdash;The
Egyptian Kite&mdash;The Raah or Glede of Scripture&mdash;The Buzzards and their
habits&mdash;The Peregrine Falcon an inhabitant of Central Palestine, and the
Lanner of the eastern parts of the country.</p></blockquote>


<p>In Lev. xi. 14 and Deut. xiv. 13, we find the Vulture among the
list of birds which the Jews were not permitted to eat. The
word which is translated as Vulture is <em>dayah</em>, and we find it
occurring again in Isaiah xxxiv. 15, "There shall the vultures
also be gathered, every one with her mate." There is no doubt,
however, that this translation of the word is an incorrect one,
and that it ought to be rendered as Kite. In Job xxviii. 7, there
is a similar word, <em>ayah</em>, which is also translated as Vulture, and
which is acknowledged to be not a Vulture, but one of the
Kites: "There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which
the vulture's eye hath not seen." Both these words are nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
identical with modern Arabic terms which are employed rather
loosely to signify several species of Kite. Buxtorf, in his
Hebrew Lexicon, gives the correct rendering, translating <em>dayah</em> as
<em>Milvus</em>, and the Vulgate in one or two places gives the same
translation, though in others it renders the word as Vulture.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="kite" id="kite"></a>
<img src="images/i_440.jpg" width="400" height="340" alt="kite" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE KITE, OR VULTURE OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Tristram, who has given much attention to this subject,
is inclined to refer the word <em>ayah</em> to the Common Kite (<em>Milvus
regalis</em>), which was once so plentiful in this country, and is now
nearly extinct; and <em>dayah</em> to the Black Kite (<em>Milvus atra</em>). He
founds this distinction on the different habits of the two species,
the Common or Red Kite being thinly scattered, and being in the
habit of soaring into the air at very great heights, and the latter
being very plentiful and gregarious.</p>

<p>We will first take the Red Kite.</p>

<p>This bird is scattered all over Palestine, feeding chiefly on the
smaller birds, mice, reptiles, and fish. In the capture of fish the
Kite is almost as expert as the osprey, darting from a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
height into the water, and bearing off the fish in its claws. The
wings of this bird are very long and powerful, and bear it
through the air in a peculiarly graceful flight. It is indeed in
consequence of this flight that it has been called the Glede, the
word being derived from its gliding movements.</p>

<p>The sight of this bird is remarkably keen and piercing, and,
from the vast elevation to which it soars when in search of
food, it is able to survey the face of the country beneath, and to
detect the partridge, quail, chicken, or other creature that will
serve it for food. This piercing sight and habit of soaring
render the passage in Job peculiarly appropriate to this species
of Kite, though it does not express the habits of the other.
Should the Kite suspect danger when forced to leave its nest, it
escapes by darting rapidly into the air, and soaring at a vast
height above the trees among which its home is made. From
that elevation it can act as a sentinel, and will not come down
again until it is assured of safety.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the habits of the <span class="smcap">Black Kite</span> (<em>Milvus atra</em>), Mr. Tristram
gives an admirable description. "The habits of the bird
bear out the allusion in Isa. xxxiv. 15, for it is, excepting
during the winter three months, so numerous everywhere in
Palestine as to be almost gregarious. It returns about the beginning
of March, and scatters itself over the whole country,
preferring especially the neighbourhood of valleys, where it is a
welcome and unmolested guest. It does not appear to attack
the poultry, among whom it may often be seen feeding on
garbage. It is very sociable, and the slaughter of a sheep at one
of the tents will soon attract a large party of black kites, which
swoop down regardless of man and guns, and enjoy a noisy
scramble for the refuse, chasing each other in a laughable
fashion, and sometimes enabling the wily raven to steal off with
the coveted morsel during their contentions. It is the butt of
all the smaller scavengers, and is evidently most unpopular with
the crows and daws, and even rollers, who enjoy the amusement
of teasing it in their tumbling flight, which is a man&oelig;uvre
most perplexing to the kite."</p>

<p>The same writer proceeds to mention that the Black Kite
unlike the red species, is very careless about the position of its
nest, and never even attempts to conceal it, sometimes building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
it in a tree, sometimes on a rock-ledge, and sometimes in a bush
growing on the rocks. It seems indeed desirous of making the
nest as conspicuous as possible, and hangs it all over with bits
of cloth, strips of bark, wings of birds, and even the cast skins
of serpents.</p>

<p>Another species (<em>Milvus Ægyptiacus</em>) is sometimes called the
Black Kite from the dark hue of its plumage, but ought rather
to retain the title of Egyptian Kite. Unlike the black kite,
this bird is a great thief, and makes as much havoc among
poultry as the red kite. It is also a robber of other birds, and if
it should happen to see a weaker bird with food, it is sure to
attack and rob it. Like the black kite, it is fond of the society
of man, and haunts the villages in great numbers, for the purpose
of eating the offal, which in Oriental towns is simply flung
into the streets to be devoured by the dogs, vultures, kites, and
other scavengers, without whom no village would be habitable
for a month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether the word <em>raah</em>, which is translated as Glede in
Deut. xiv. 13, among the list of birds which may not be eaten,
is one of these species of Kite, or a bird of a different group, is a
very doubtful point. This is the only passage in which the
word occurs, and we have but small grounds for definitely identifying
it with any one species. The Hebrew Bible retains the
word Glede, but affixes a mark of doubt to it, and several commentators
are of opinion that the word is a wrong reading of
<em>dayah</em>, which occurs in the parallel passage in Lev. xi. 14. The
reading of the Septuagint follows this interpretation, and renders
it as Vulture in both cases. Buxtorf translates the word <em>raah</em>
as Rook, but suggests that <em>dayah</em> is the correct reading.</p>

<p>Accepting, however, the word <em>raah</em>, we shall find that it is
derived from a root which signifies sight or vision, especially of
some particular object, so that a piercing sight would therefore
be the chief characteristic of the bird, which, as we know, is one
of the attributes of the Kites, together with other birds of prey,
so that it evidently must be classed among the group with which
we are now concerned. It has been suggested that, granting
the <em>raah</em> to be a species distinct from the <em>dayah</em>, it is a collective
term for the larger falcons and buzzards, several species of which
inhabit Palestine, and are not distinctly mentioned in the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>Several species of buzzard inhabit the Holy Land, and there
is no particular reason why they should be mentioned except by
a collective name. Some of the buzzards are very large birds,
and though their wings are short when compared with those of
the vultures and eagles, the flight of the bird is both powerful
and graceful. It is not, however, remarkable for swiftness, and
never was employed, like the falcon, in catching other birds,
being reckoned as one of the useless and cowardly birds of
prey. In consonance with this opinion, to compare a man to a
buzzard was thought a most cutting insult.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="peregrine" id="peregrine"></a>
<img src="images/i_443.jpg" width="400" height="402" alt="peregrine" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PEREGRINE FALCON, OR GLEDE OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a general rule, it does not chase its prey like the eagles or
the large-winged falcons, but perches on a rock or tree, watches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
for some animal on which it can feed, pounces on it, and returns
to its post, the whole movements being very like those of the
flycatcher. This sluggishness of disposition, and the soft and
almost owl-like plumage, have been the means of bringing the
bird into contempt among falconers.</p>

<p>As to the large falcons, which seem to be included in the term
<em>raah</em>, the chief of them is the Peregrine Falcon (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>),
which is tolerably common in the Holy Land. In his
"Land of Israel," Mr. Tristram gives several notices of this bird,
from which we may take the following picture from a description
of a scene at Endor. "Dreary and desolate looked the plain,
though of exuberant fertility. Here and there might be seen
a small flock of sheep or herd of cattle, tended by three or
four mounted villagers, armed with their long firelocks, and
pistols and swords, on the watch against any small party of
marauding cattle-lifters.</p>

<p>"Griffon vultures were wheeling in circles far over the
rounded top of Tabor; and here and there an eagle was soaring
beneath them in search of food, but at a most inconvenient distance
from our guns. Hariers were sweeping more rapidly and
closely over the ground, where lambs appeared to be their only
prey; and a noble peregrine falcon, which in Central Palestine
does not give place to the more eastern lanner, was perched on
an isolated rock, calmly surveying the scene, and permitting us
to approach and scrutinize him at our leisure."</p>

<p>The habit of perching on the rock, as mentioned above, is very
characteristic of the Peregrine Falcon, who loves the loftiest
and most craggy cliffs, and makes its nest in spots which can
only be reached by a bold and experienced climber. The nests
of this bird are never built in close proximity, the Peregrine
preferring to have its home at least a mile from the nest of any
other of its kinsfolk. Sometimes it makes a nest in lofty trees,
taking possession of the deserted home of some other bird; but
it loves the cliff better than the tree, and seldom builds in the
latter when the former is attainable.</p>

<p>In the passage from the "Land of Israel" is mentioned the
<span class="smcap">Lanner Falcon</span> (<em>Falco lanarius</em>), another of the larger falcons
to which the term <em>raah</em> may have been applied.</p>

<p>This bird is much larger than the Peregrine Falcon, and, indeed,
is very little less than the great gerfalcon itself. It is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
of the birds that were reckoned among the noble falcons; and
the female, which is much larger and stronger than the male,
was employed for the purpose of chasing the kite, whose long
and powerful wings could not always save it from such a foe.</p>

<p>Although the Lanner has been frequently mentioned among
the British birds, and the name is therefore familiar to us, it is
not even a visitor of our island. The mistake has occurred by
an error in nomenclature, the young female Peregrine Falcon,
which is much larger and darker than the male bird, having
been erroneously called by the name of Lanner.</p>

<h2>THE HAWK.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Netz or Hawk&mdash;Number of species probably grouped under that name&mdash;Rare
occurrence of the word&mdash;The Sparrow-Hawk and its general habits&mdash;Its place
of nesting&mdash;The Kestrel, or Wind-hover&mdash;Various names by which it is known
in England&mdash;Its mode of feeding and curious flight&mdash;The Hariers&mdash;Probable
derivation of the name&mdash;Species of Harier known to inhabit Palestine&mdash;Falconry
apparently unknown to the ancient Jews.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is no doubt that a considerable number of species are
grouped together under the single title Netz, or Hawk, a word
which is rightly enough translated. That a great number of
birds should have been thus confounded together is not surprising,
seeing that even in this country and at the present time,
the single word Hawk may signify any one of at least twelve
different species. The various falcons, the hariers, the kestrel,
the sparrow-hawk, and the hobbies, are one and all called
popularly by the name of Hawk, and it is therefore likely
that the Hebrew word Netz would signify as many species as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the English word Hawk. From them we will select one or two
of the principal species.</p>

<p>In the first place, the word is of very rare occurrence. We
only find it three times. It first occurs in Lev. xi. 16, in which
it is named, together with the eagle, the ossifrage, and many
other birds, as among the unclean creatures, to eat which was an
abomination. It is next found in the parallel passage in Deut.
xiv. 15, neither of which portions of Scripture need be quoted
at length.</p>

<p>That the word <em>netz</em> was used in its collective sense is very
evident from the addition which is made to it in both cases.
The Hawk, "after its kind," is forbidden, showing therefore
that several kinds or species of Hawk were meant. Indeed, any
specific detail would be quite needless, as the collective term
was quite a sufficient indication, and, having named the vultures,
eagles, and larger birds of prey, the simple word <em>netz</em> was considered
by the sacred writer as expressing the rest of the birds
of prey.</p>

<p>We find the word once more in that part of the Bible to which
we usually look for any reference to natural history. In Job
xxxix. 26, we have the words, "Doth the hawk fly by thy
wisdom, and turn [or stretch] her wings toward the south?"
The precise signification of this passage is rather doubtful, but
it is generally considered to refer to the migration of several
of the Hawk tribe. That the bird in question was distinguished
for its power of flight is evident from the fact that the sacred
poet has selected that one attribute as the most characteristic
of the Netz.</p>

<p>Taking first the typical example of the Hawks, we find that
the <span class="smcap">Sparrow-Hawk</span> (<em>Accipiter nisus</em>) is plentiful in Palestine,
finding abundant food in the smaller birds of the country. It
selects for its nest just the spots which are so plentiful in the
Holy Land, <em>i.e.</em> the crannies of rocks, and the tops of tall trees.
Sometimes it builds in deserted ruins, but its favourite spot
seems to be the lofty tree-top, and, in default of that, the rock-crevice.
It seldom builds a nest of its own, but takes possession
of that which has been made by some other bird. Some ornithologists
think that it looks out for a convenient nest, say of
the crow or magpie, and then ejects the rightful owner. I am
inclined to think, however, that it mostly takes possession of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
nest that is already deserted, without running the risk of fighting
such enemies as a pair of angry magpies. This opinion is
strengthened by the fact that the bird resorts to the same nest
year after year.</p>

<p>It is a bold and dashing bird, though of no great size, and
when wild and free displays a courage which it seems to lose in
captivity. As is the case with so many of the birds, the female
is much larger than her mate, the former weighing about six
ounces, and measuring about a foot in length, and the latter
weighing above nine ounces, and measuring about fifteen inches
in length.</p>


<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="kestrel" id="kestrel"></a>
<img src="images/i_448.jpg" width="400" height="337" alt="kestrel" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KESTREL HOVERING OVER A FIELD IN SEARCH OF PREY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most plentiful of the smaller Hawks of Palestine is the
<span class="smcap">Common Kestrel</span>. This is the same species which is known
under the names of Kestrel, Wind-hover, and Stannel Hawk.</p>

<p>It derives its name of Wind-hover from its remarkable habit
of hovering, head to windward, over some spot for many minutes
together. This action is always performed at a moderate distance
from the ground; some naturalists saying that the Hawk in
question never hovers at an elevation exceeding forty feet, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
others, myself included, have seen the bird hovering at a height
of twice as many yards. Generally, however, it prefers a lower
distance, and is able by employing this man&oelig;uvre to survey a
tolerably large space beneath. As its food consists in a very
great measure of field-mice, the Kestrel is thus able by means
of its telescopic eyesight to see if a mouse rises from its hole;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
and if it should do so, the bird drops on it and secures it in its
claws.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="hover" id="hover"></a>
<img src="images/i_449.jpg" width="400" height="606" alt="hover" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WIND-HOVER, OR KESTREL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Unlike the sparrow-hawk, the Kestrel is undoubtedly gregarious,
and will build its nest in close proximity to the habitations
of other birds, a number of nests being often found within
a few yards of each other. Mr. Tristram remarks that he has
found its nest in the recesses of the caverns occupied by the
griffon vultures, and that the Kestrel also builds close to the
eagles, and is the only bird which is permitted to do so. It also
builds in company with the jackdaw.</p>

<p>Several species of Kestrel are known, and of them at least
two inhabit the Holy Land, the second being a much smaller
bird than the Common Kestrel, and feeding almost entirely on
insects, which it catches with its claws, the common chafers
forming its usual prey. Great numbers of these birds live
together, and as they rather affect the society of mankind, they
are fond of building their nests in convenient crannies in the
mosques or churches. Independently of its smaller size, it may
be distinguished from the Common Kestrel by the whiteness of
its claws.</p>

<p>The illustration is drawn from a sketch taken from life. The
bird hovered so near a house, and remained so long in one place,
that the artist fixed a telescope and secured an exact sketch of
the bird in the peculiar attitude which it is so fond of assuming.
After a while, the Kestrel ascended to a higher elevation, and
then resumed its hovering, in the attitude which is shown in the
upper figure. In consequence of the great abundance of this
species in Palestine, and the peculiarly conspicuous mode of
balancing itself in the air while in search of prey, we may feel
sure that the sacred writers had it specially in their minds when
they used the collective term Netz.</p>

<p>It is easily trained, and, although in the old hawking days it
was considered a bird which a noble could not carry, it can be
trained to chase the smaller birds as successfully as the falcons
can be taught to pursue the heron. The name Tinnunculus is
supposed by some to have been given to the bird in allusion to
its peculiar cry, which is clear, shrill, and consists of a single
note several times repeated.</p>

<p>On page 444 the reader may see a representation of a pair of
<span class="smcap">Harier Hawks</span> flying below the rock on which the peregrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
falcon has perched, and engaged in pursuing one of the smaller
birds.</p>

<p>They have been introduced because several species of Harier
are to be found in Palestine, where they take, among the plains
and lowlands, the place which is occupied by the other hawks
and falcons among the rocks.</p>

<p>The name of Harier appears to be given to these birds on
account of their habit of regularly quartering the ground over
which they fly when in search of prey, just like hounds when
searching for hares. This bird is essentially a haunter of flat
and marshy lands, where it finds frogs, mice, lizards, on which
it usually feeds. It does not, however, confine itself to such
food, but will chase and kill most of the smaller birds, and
occasionally will catch even the leveret, the rabbit, the partridge,
and the curlew.</p>

<p>When it chases winged prey, it seldom seizes the bird in the
air, but almost invariably keeps above it, and gradually drives it
to the ground. It will be seen, therefore, that its flight is
mostly low, as suits the localities in which it lives, and it seldom
soars to any great height, except when it amuses itself by rising
and wheeling in circles together with its mate. This proceeding
generally takes place before nest-building. The usual flight is
a mixture of that of the kestrel and the falcon, the Harier
sometimes poising itself over some particular spot, and at others
shooting forwards through the air with motionless wings.</p>

<p>Unlike the falcons and most of the hawks, the Harier does
not as a rule perch on rocks, but prefers to sit very upright on
the ground, perching generally on a mole-hill, stone, or some
similar elevation. Even its nest is made on the ground, and is
composed of reeds, sedges, sticks, and similar matter, materials
that can be procured from marshy land. The nest is always
elevated a foot or so from the ground, and has occasionally been
found on the top of a mound more than a yard in height. It
is, however, conjectured that in such cases the mound is made
by one nest being built upon the remains of another. The
object of the elevated nest is probably to preserve the eggs in
case of a flood.</p>

<p>At least five species of Hariers are known to exist in the
Holy Land, two of which are among the British birds, namely,
the Marsh Harier (<em>Circus æruginosus</em>), sometimes called the Duck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Hawk and the Moor Buzzard, and the Hen Harier (<em>Circus
cyaneus</em>), sometimes called the White Hawk, Dove Hawk, or Blue
Hawk, on account of the plumage of the male, which differs
greatly according to age; and the Ring-tailed Hawk, on account
of the dark bars which appear on the tail of the female. All
the Hariers are remarkable for the circlet of feathers that surrounds
the eyes, and which resembles in a lesser degree the bold
feather-circle around the eye of the owl tribe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before taking leave of the Hawks, it is as well to notice the
entire absence in the Scriptures of any reference to falconry.
Now, seeing that the art of catching birds and animals by means
of Hawks is a favourite amusement among Orientals, as has
already been mentioned when treating of the gazelle (page 168),
and knowing the unchanging character of the East, we cannot
but think it remarkable that no reference should be made to this
sport in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>It is true that in Palestine itself there would be but little
scope for falconry, the rough hilly ground and abundance of
cultivated soil rendering such an amusement almost impossible.
Besides, the use of the falcon implies that of the horse, and, as
we have already seen, the horse was scarcely ever used except
for military purposes.</p>

<p>Had, therefore, the experience of the Israelites been confined
to Palestine, there would have been good reason for the silence
of the sacred writers on this subject. But when we remember
that the surrounding country is well adapted for falconry, that
the amusement is practised there at the present day, and that
the Israelites passed so many years as captives in other countries,
we can but wonder that the Hawks should never be mentioned
as aids to bird-catching. We find that other bird-catching
implements are freely mentioned and employed as familiar
symbols, such as the gin, the net, the snare, the trap, and so
forth; but that there is not a single passage in which the Hawks
are mentioned as employed in falconry.</p>

<h2>THE OWL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The words which have been translated as Owl&mdash;Use made of the Little Owl in bird-catching&mdash;Habits
of the bird&mdash;The Barn, Screech, or White Owl a native of
Palestine&mdash;The Yanshûph, or Egyptian Eagle Owl&mdash;Its food and nest.</p></blockquote>


<p>In various parts of the Old Testament there occur several
words which are translated as <span class="smcap">Owl</span> in the Authorized Version,
and in most cases the rendering is acknowledged to be the
correct one, while in one or two instances there is a difference of
opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>In Lev. xi. 16, 17, we find the following birds reckoned among
those which are an abomination, and which might not be eaten
by the Israelites: "The owl, and the night-hawk, and the
cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind;</p>

<p>"And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very likely that the Little Owl here mentioned is identical
with the Boomah of the Arabs. It is a bird that is common in
Europe, where it is much valued by bird-catchers, who employ it as
a means of attracting small birds to their traps. They place it on
the top of a long pole, and carry it into the fields, where they
plant the pole in the ground. This Owl has a curious habit of
swaying its body backwards and forwards, and is sure to attract
the notice of all the small birds in the neighbourhood. It is
well known that the smaller birds have a peculiar hatred to the
Owl, and never can pass it without mobbing it, assembling in
great numbers, and so intent on their occupation that they seem
to be incapable of perceiving anything but the object of their
hatred. Even rooks, magpies, and hawks are taken by this
simple device.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Little Owl was used for this object by the
ancient inhabitants of Palestine is rather doubtful; but as they
certainly did so employ decoy birds for the purpose of attracting
game, it is not unlikely that the Little Owl was found to serve
as a decoy. We shall learn more about the system of decoy-birds
when we come to the partridge.</p>

<p>The Little Owl is to be found in almost every locality, caring
little whether it takes up its residence in cultivated grounds, in
villages, among deserted ruins, or in places where man has
never lived. As, however, it is protected by the natives, it
prefers the neighbourhood of villages, and may be seen quietly
perched in some favourite spot, not taking the trouble to move
unless it be approached closely. And to detect a perched Owl
is not at all an easy matter, as the bird has a way of selecting
some spot where the colours of its plumage harmonize so well
with the surrounding objects that the large eyes are often the
first indication of its presence. Many a time I have gone to
search after Owls, and only been made aware of them by the
sharp angry snap that they make when startled.</p>

<p>The common and well-known Barn Owl, also inhabits Palestine.
Like the Little Owl, it affects the neighbourhood of man,
though it may be found in ruins and similar localities. An old
ruined building is sure to be tenanted by the Barn Owl, whose
nightly shrieks very often terrify the belated wanderer, and
make him fancy that the place is haunted by disturbed spirits.
Such being the habits of the bird, it is likely that in the East,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
where popular superstition has peopled every well with its jinn
and every ruin with its spirit, the nocturnal cry of this bird,
which is often called the Screech Owl from its note, should be
exceedingly terrifying, and would impress itself on the minds of
sacred writers as a fit image of solitude, terror, and desolation.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LITTLE OWL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Screech Owl is scarcely less plentiful in Palestine than
the Little Owl, and, whether or not it be mentioned under a
separate name, is sure to be one of the birds to which allusion is
made in the Scriptures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another name now rises before us: this is the Yanshûph,
translated as the Great Owl, a word which occurs not only in
the prohibitory passages of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, but in
the Book of Isaiah. In that book, ch. xxxiv. ver. 10, 11, we find
the following passage: "From generation to generation it shall
lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
(<em>yanshûph</em>) also and the raven shall dwell in it: and He shall
stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of
emptiness." The Jewish Bible follows the same reading.</p>

<p>It is most probable that the Great Owl or Yanshûph is the
<span class="smcap">Egyptian Eagle Owl</span> (<em>Bubo ascalaphus</em>), a bird which is closely
allied to the great Eagle Owl of Europe (<em>Bubo maximus</em>), and
the Virginian Eared Owl (<em>Bubo Virginianus</em>) of America. This
fine bird measures some two feet in length, and looks much
larger than its real size, owing to the thick coating of feathers
which it wears in common with all true Owls, and the ear-like
feather tufts on the top of its head, which it can raise or depress
at pleasure. Its plumage is light tawny.</p>

<p>This bird has a special predilection for deserted places and
ruins, and may at the present time be seen on the very spots of
which the prophet spoke in his prediction. It is very plentiful
in Egypt, where the vast ruins are the only relics of a creed
long passed away or modified into other forms of religion, and
its presence only intensifies rather than diminishes the feeling
of loneliness that oppresses the traveller as he passes among the
ruins.</p>

<p>The European Eagle Owl has all the habits of its Asiatic
congener. It dwells in places far from the neighbourhood of
man, and during the day is hidden in some deep and dark recess,
its enormous eyes not being able to endure the light of day. In
the evening it issues from its retreat, and begins its search after
prey, which consists of various birds, quadrupeds, reptiles, fish,
and even insects when it can find nothing better.</p>

<p>On account of its comparatively large dimensions, it is able
to overcome even the full-grown hare and rabbit, while the lamb
and the young fawn occasionally fall victims to its voracity.
It seems never to chase any creature on the wing, but floats
silently through the air, its soft and downy plumage deadening
the sound of its progress, and suddenly drops on the unsuspecting
prey while it is on the ground.</p>

<p>The nest of this Owl is made in the crevices of rocks, or in
ruins, and is a very large one, composed of sticks and twigs,
lined with a tolerably large heap of dried herbage, the parent
Owls returning to the same spot year after year. Should it not
be able to find either a rock or a ruin, it contents itself with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a><br /><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a><br /><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
hollow in the ground, and there lays its eggs, which are generally
two in number, though occasionally a third egg is found. The
Egyptian Eagle Owl does much the same thing, burrowing in
sand-banks, and retreating, if it fears danger, into the hollow
where its nest has been made.</p>

<p>In the large illustration the two last-mentioned species are
given. The Egyptian Eagle Owl is seen with its back towards
the spectator, grasping in its talons a dead hare, and with ear-tufts
erect is looking towards the Barn Owl, which is contemplating
in mingled anger and fear the proceedings of the larger
bird. Near them is perched a raven, in order to carry out more
fully the prophetic words, "the owl also and the raven shall
dwell in it."</p>

<h2>THE NIGHT-HAWK.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Different interpretations of the word Tachmâs&mdash;Probability that it signifies the
Nightjar&mdash;Various names of the bird&mdash;Its remarkable jarring cry, and wheeling
flight&mdash;Mode of feeding&mdash;Boldness of the bird&mdash;Deceptive appearance of
its size.</p></blockquote>


<p>We next come to the vexed question of the word Tachmâs
which is rendered in the Authorized Version as <span class="smcap">Night-hawk</span>.</p>

<p>This word only occurs among the list of prohibited birds (see
Lev. xi. 16, and Deut. xiv. 15), and has caused great controversies
among commentators. The balance of probability
seems to lie between two interpretations,&mdash;namely, that which
considers the word <em>tachmâs</em> to signify the Night-hawk, and that
which translates it as Owl. For both of these interpretations
much is to be said, and it cannot be denied that of the two
the latter is perhaps the preferable. If so, the White or Barn
Owl is probably the particular species to which reference is
made.</p>

<p>Still, many commentators think that the Night-hawk or
Nightjar is the bird which is signified by the word <em>tachmâs</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
and, as we have already treated of the owls, we will accept the
rendering of the Authorized Version. Moreover, the Jewish
Bible follows the same translation, and renders <em>tachmâs</em> as
Night-hawk, but affixes the mark of doubt.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="nacht" id="nacht"></a>
<img src="images/i_462.jpg" width="400" height="346" alt="nacht" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE NIGHT-HAWK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is not unlikely that the Jews may have reckoned this bird
among the owls, just as is the case with the uneducated among
ourselves, who popularly speak of the Nightjar as the Fern Owl,
Churn Owl, or Jar Owl, the two last names being given to
it on account of its peculiar cry. There are few birds, indeed,
which have received a greater variety of popular names, for,
besides the Goatsucker and the five which have already been
mentioned, there are the Wheel-bird and Dor-hawk, the former
of these names having been given to the bird on account of its
wheeling round the trees while seeking for prey, and the latter
on account of the dor-beetles on which it largely feeds.</p>

<p>This curious variety of names is probably due to the very
conspicuous character of the Nightjar, its strange, jarring, weird-like
cry forcing itself on the ear of the least attentive, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
breaks the silence of night. It hardly seems like the cry of
a bird, but rather resembles the sound of a pallet falling on
the cogs of a rapidly-working wheel. It begins in the dusk of
evening, the long, jarring note being rolled out almost interminably,
until the hearer wonders how the bird can have breath
enough for such a prolonged sound. The hearer may hold his
breath as long as he can, take a full inspiration, hold his breath
afresh, and repeat this process over and over again, and yet the
Nightjar continues to trill out its rapid notes without a moment's
cessation for breath, the sound now rising shrill and clear, and
now sinking as if the bird were far off, but never ceasing for an
instant.</p>

<p>This remarkable cry has caused the uneducated rustics to
look upon the bird with superstitious dread, every one knowing
its cry full well, though to many the bird is unknown except
by its voice. It is probable that, in the days when Moses wrote
the Law, so conspicuous a bird was well known to the Jews,
and we may therefore conjecture that it was one of those birds
which he would specially mention by name.</p>

<p>The general habits of the Nightjar are quite as remarkable as
its note. It feeds on the wing, chasing and capturing the various
moths, beetles, and other insects that fly abroad by night. It
may be seen wheeling round the branches of some tree, the oak
being a special favourite, sometimes circling round it, and sometimes
rising high in the air, and the next moment skimming
along the ground. Suddenly it will disappear, and next moment
its long trilling cry is heard from among the branches of the
tree round which it has been flying. To see it while singing is
almost impossible, for it has a habit of sitting longitudinally on
the branch, and not across it, like most birds, so that the outline
of its body cannot be distinguished from that of the bough of
which it is seated. As suddenly as it began, the sound ceases,
and simultaneously the bird may be seen wheeling again through
the air with its noiseless flight.</p>

<p>Being a very bold bird, and not much afraid of man, it allows
a careful observer to watch its movements clearly. I have often
stood close to the tree round which several Nightjars were
circling, and seen them chase their prey to the ground within a
yard or two of the spot on which I was standing. The flight of
the Nightjar is singularly graceful. Swift as the swallow itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
it presents a command of wing that is really wonderful, gliding
through the air with consummate ease, wheeling and doubling
in pursuit of some active moth, whose white wings glitter
against the dark background, while the sober plumage of its
pursuer is scarcely visible, passing often within a few feet of the
spectator, and yet not a sound or a rustle will reach his ears.
Sometimes the bird is said to strike its wings together over its
back, so as to produce a sharp snapping sound, intended to
express anger at the presence of the intruder. I never, however,
heard this sound, though I have watched the bird so
often.</p>

<p>Owing to the soft plumage with which it is clad, this bird,
like the owls, looks larger than really is the case. It is between
ten and eleven inches in length, with an expanse of wing of
twenty inches, and yet weighs rather less than three ounces.
Its large mouth, like that of the swallow tribe, opens as far as
the eyes, and is furnished with a set of <em>vibrissæ</em> or bristles, which
remind the observer of the "whale-bone" which is set on the
jaw of the Greenland whale.</p>

<h2>THE SWALLOW.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Identification of the smaller birds&mdash;Oriental indifference to natural history&mdash;Use
of collective terms&mdash;The Swallow&mdash;The Bird of Liberty&mdash;Swallows and Swifts&mdash;Variety
of small birds found in Palestine&mdash;The Swallows of Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>Difficult as is the identification of the mammalia mentioned
in the Bible, that of the birds is much more intricate.</p>

<p>Some of the larger birds can be identified with tolerable certainty,
but when we come to the smaller and less conspicuous
species, we are at once lost in uncertainty, and at the best can
only offer conjectures. The fact is, the Jews of old had no
idea of discriminating between the smaller birds, unless they
happened to be tolerably conspicuous by plumage or by voice.
We need not be much surprised at this. The Orientals of
the present day do precisely the same thing, and not only
fail to discriminate between the smaller birds, but absolutely
have no names for them.</p>

<p>By them, the shrikes, the swallows, the starlings, the thrushes,
the larks, the warblers, and all the smaller birds, are called by
a common title, derived from the twittering sound of their
voices, only one or two of them having any distinctive titles.
They look upon the birds much as persons ignorant of entomology
look at a collection of moths. There is not much
difficulty in discriminating between the great hawk-moths, and
perhaps in giving a name to one or two of them which are
specially noticeable for any peculiarity of form or colour;
but when they come to the "Rustics," the "Carpets," the
"Wainscots," and similar groups, they are utterly lost; and,
though they may be able to see the characteristic marks when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
the moths are placed side by side, they are incapable of distinguishing
them separately, and, to their uneducated eyes, twenty
or thirty species appear absolutely alike.</p>

<p>I believe that there is no country where a knowledge of practical
natural history is so widely extended as in England, and
yet how few educated persons are there who, if taken along a
country lane, can name the commonest weed or insect, or distinguish
between a sparrow, a linnet, a hedge-sparrow, and a
chaffinch. Nay, how many are there who, if challenged even to
repeat the names of twelve little birds, would be unable to do so
without some consideration, much less to know them if the birds
were placed before them.</p>

<p>Such being the case in a country where the capability of
observation is more or less cultivated in every educated person,
we may well expect that a profound ignorance on the subject
should exist in countries where that faculty is absolutely neglected
as a matter of education. Moreover, in England, there
is a comparatively limited list of birds, whereas in Palestine
are found nearly all those which are reckoned among British
birds, and many other species besides. Those which reside in
England reside also for the most part in Palestine, while the
greater part of the migratory birds pass, as we might expect,
into the Holy Land and the neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>If then we put together the two facts of an unobservant
people and a vastly extended fauna, we shall not wonder that
so many collective terms are used in the Scriptures, one word
often doing duty for twenty or thirty species. The only plan,
therefore, which can be adopted, is to mention generally the
birds which were probably grouped under one name, and to
describe briefly one or two of the most prominent.</p>

<p>It is, however, rather remarkable that the song of birds does
not appear to be noticed by the sacred writers. We might
expect that several of the prophets, especially Isaiah, the great
sacred poet, who drew so many of his images from natural
objects, would have found in the song of birds some metaphor
expressive of sweetness or joy. We might expect that in the
Book of Job, in which so many creatures are mentioned, the
singing of birds would be brought as prominently forward as
the neck clothed with thunder of the horse, the tameless freedom
of the wild ass, the voracity of the vulture, and the swiftness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
of the ostrich. We might expect the song of birds to be
mentioned by Amos, the herdman of Tekoa, who introduces
into his rugged poem the roar of the old lion and the wail of
the cub, the venom of the serpent hidden in the wattled wall of
the herdman's hut, and the ravages of the palmer-worm among
the olives. Above all, we might expect that in the Psalms there
would be many allusions to the notes of the various birds which
have formed such fruitful themes for the poets of later times.
There are, however, in the whole of the Scriptures but two
passages in which the song of birds is mentioned, and even in
these only a passing allusion is made.</p>

<p>One of them occurs in Psalm civ. 12: "By them (<em>i.e.</em> the
springs of water) shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
which sing among the branches." This passage is perhaps
rendered more closely in the Jewish Bible: "Over them dwell
the fowls of the heaven; they let their voices resound (or give
their voice) from between the foliage."</p>

<p>The other occurs in Eccles. xii. 4: "And the doors shall be
shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and
he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters
of music shall be brought low." The word which is here translated
as "bird," is that which is rendered in some places as
"sparrow," in others as "fowl," and in others as "bird." Even
in these passages, as the reader will have noticed, no marks of
appreciation are employed, and we hear nothing of the sweetness,
joyousness, or mournfulness of the bird's song.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now proceed to the words which have been translated
as Swallow in the Authorized Version.</p>

<p>These are two in number, namely, <em>derôr</em> and <em>agar</em>. Hebraists
are, however, agreed that the latter word has been wrongly
applied, the translators having interchanged the signification of
two contiguous words.</p>

<p>We will therefore first take the word <em>deror</em>. This word
signifies liberty, and is well applied to the Swallow, the bird of
freedom. It is remarkable, by the way, how some of the old
commentators have contrived to perplex themselves about a very
simple matter. One of them comments upon the bird as being
"so called, because it has the liberty of building in the houses
of mankind." Another takes a somewhat similar view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a><br /><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
case, but puts it in a catechetical form: "Why is the swallow
called the bird of liberty? Because it lives both in the house
and in the field." It is scarcely necessary to point out to the
reader that the "liberty" to which allusion is made is the
liberty of flight, the bird coming and going at its appointed
times, and not being capable of domestication.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 329px;"><a name="lost" id="lost"></a>
<img src="images/i_468.jpg" width="329" height="600" alt="lost" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">LOST FROM THE FLOCK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Several kinds of Swallow are known in Palestine, including
the true Swallows, the martins, and the swifts, and, as we shall
presently see, it is likely that one of these groups was distinguished
by a separate name. Whether or not the word <em>deror</em>
included other birds beside the Swallows is rather doubtful,
though not at all unlikely; and if so, it is probable that any
swift-winged insectivorous bird would be called by the name of
Deror, irrespective of its size or colour.</p>

<p>The bee-eaters, for example, are probably among the number
of the birds grouped together under the word <em>deror</em>, and we
may conjecture that the same is the case with the sunbirds,
those bright-plumed little beings that take in the Old World the
place occupied by the humming-birds in the New, and often
mistaken for them by travellers who are not acquainted with
ornithology. One of these birds, the <em>Nectarinia Oseæ</em>, is described
by Mr. Tristram as "a tiny little creature of gorgeous
plumage, rivalling the humming-birds of America in the metallic
lustre of its feathers&mdash;green and purple, with brilliant red and
orange plumes under its shoulders."</p>

<p>In order to account for the singular variety of animal life
which is to be found in Palestine, and especially the exceeding
diversity of species among the birds, we must remember that
Palestine is a sort of microcosm in itself, comprising within its
narrow boundaries the most opposite conditions of temperature,
climate, and soil. Some parts are rocky, barren, and mountainous,
chilly and cold at the top, and acting as channels
through which the winds blow almost continuously. The cliffs
are full of holes, rifts, and caverns, some natural, some artificial,
and some of a mixed kind, the original caverns having been
enlarged and improved by the hand of man.</p>

<p>As a contrast to this rough and ragged region, there lie close
at hand large fertile plains, affording pasturage for unnumbered
cattle, and of a tolerably equable temperature, so that the
animals which are pastured in it can find food throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
the year. Through the centre of Palestine runs the Jordan, fertilizing
its banks with perpetual verdure, and ending its course
in the sulphurous and bituminous waters of the Dead Sea,
under whose waves the ruins of the wicked cities are supposed
to lie. Westward we have the shore of the Mediterranean with
its tideless waves of the salt sea, and on the eastward of the
mountain range that runs nearly parallel to the sea is the great
Lake of Tiberias, so large as to have earned the name of the Sea
of Galilee.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="swifter" id="swifter"></a>
<img src="images/i_470.jpg" width="400" height="399" alt="swift" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SWALLOW AND SWIFT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Under these favourable conditions, therefore, the number of
species which are found in Palestine is perhaps greater than can
be seen in any other part of the earth of the same dimensions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
and it seems probable that for this reason, among many others,
Palestine was selected to be the Holy Land. If, for example,
the Christian Church had been originated under the tropics,
those who lived in a cold climate could scarcely have understood
the language in which the Scriptures must necessarily have been
couched. Had it, on the contrary, taken its rise in the Arctic
regions, the inhabitants of the tropics and temperate regions
could not have comprehended the imagery in which the teachings
of Scripture must have been conveyed. But the small and
geographically insignificant Land of Palestine combines in itself
many of the characteristics which belong respectively to the
cold, the temperate, and the hot regions of the world, so that the
terms in which the sacred writings are couched are intelligible
to a very great proportion of the world's inhabitants.</p>

<p>This being the case, we naturally expect to find that several
species of the Swallow are inhabitants of Palestine, if so migratory
a bird can be said to be an inhabitant of any one country.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SWALLOW'S FAVOURITE HAUNT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The chief characteristic of the Swallow, the "bird of freedom,"
is that it cannot endure captivity, but is forced by instinct
to pass from one country to another for the purpose of preserving
itself in a tolerably equable temperature, moving northwards
as the spring ripens into summer, and southwards as autumn
begins to sink into winter. By some marvellous instinct it
traces its way over vast distances, passing over hundreds of
miles where nothing but the sea is beneath it, and yet at the
appointed season returning with unerring certainty to the spot
where it was hatched. How it is guided no one knows, but the
fact is certain, that Swallows, remarkable for some peculiarity
by which they could be at once identified, have been observed
to leave the country on their migration, and to return in the
following year to the identical nest whence they started.</p>

<p>Its habit of making its nest among the habitations of mankind
is mentioned in a well-known passage of the Psalms: "The sparrow
hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where
she may lay her young, even Thine altars, O Lord of Hosts, my
King and my God" (Ps. lxxxiv. 3). The Swallow seems in all
countries to have enjoyed the protection of man, and to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
been suffered to build in peace under his roof. We find the same
idea prevalent in the New World as well as the Old, and it is
rather curious that the presence of the bird should so generally
be thought to bring luck to a house.</p>

<p>In some parts of our country, a farmer would not dare to kill
a Swallow or break down its nest, simply because he thinks
that if he did so his cows would fail to give their due supply
of milk. The connexion between the milking of a cow in the
field and the destruction of a Swallow's nest in the house is not
very easy to see, but nevertheless such is the belief. This idea
ranks with that which asserts the robin and the wren to be the
male and female of the same species, and to be under some
special divine protection.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the origin of this superstition, whether it
be derived from some forgotten source, or whether it be the
natural result of the confiding nature of the bird, the Swallow
enjoys at the present day the protection of man, and builds freely
in his houses, and even his places of worship. The heathen
temples, the Mahometan mosques, and the Christian churches
are alike inhabited by the Swallow, who seems to know her
security, and often places her nest where a child might reach it.</p>

<p>The bird does not, however, restrict itself to the habitations
of man, though it prefers them; and in those places where no
houses are to be found, and yet where insects are plentiful, it
takes possession of the clefts of rocks, and therein makes its
nest. Many instances are known where the Swallow has chosen
the most extraordinary places for its nest. It has been known
to build year after year on the frame of a picture, between the
handles of a pair of shears hung on the wall, on a lamp-bracket,
in a table-drawer, on a door-knocker, and similar strange
localities.</p>

<p>The swiftness of flight for which this bird is remarkable is
noticed by the sacred writers. "As the bird by wandering, as
the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come"
(Prov. xxvi. 2). This passage is given rather differently in the
Jewish Bible, though the general sense remains the same:
"As the bird is ready to flee, as the swallow to fly away; so a
causeless execration, it shall not come." It is possible, however,
that this passage may allude rather to the migration than the
swiftness of the bird.</p>

<h2>THE HOOPOE, OR LAPWING OF SCRIPTURE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The "Dukiphath" of Scripture&mdash;Various interpretations of the word&mdash;The
Hoopoe&mdash;Its beauty and ill reputation&mdash;The unpleasant odour of its nest&mdash;Food
of the Hoopoe&mdash;Its beautiful nest, and remarkable gestures&mdash;A curious
legend of Solomon and the Hoopoe.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the two parallel chapters, Lev. xi. and Deut. xiv., there occurs
the name of a bird which is translated in the Authorized Version,
Lapwing: "And the stork, the heron after her kind, the lapwing,
and the bat."</p>

<p>The Hebrew word is <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">dukiphath</i>, and various interpretations
have been proposed for it, some taking it to be the common
domestic fowl, others the cock-of-the-woods, or capercailzie,
while others have preferred to translate it as Hoopoe. The
Jewish Bible retains the word lapwing, but adds the mark of
doubt. Commentators are, however, agreed that of all these
interpretations, that which renders the word as <span class="smcap">Hoopoe</span> (<em>Upupa
epops</em>) is the best.</p>

<p>There would be no particular object in the prohibition of such
a bird as the lapwing, or any of its kin, while there would be
very good reasons for the same injunction with regard to the
Hoopoe.</p>

<p>In spite of the beauty of the bird, it has always had rather an
ill reputation, and, whether in Europe or Asia, its presence
seems to be regarded by the ignorant with a kind of superstitious
aversion. This universal distaste for the Hoopoe is
probably occasioned by an exceedingly pungent and disagreeable
odour which fills the nest of the bird, and which infects
for a considerable time the hand which is employed to take
the eggs.</p>

<p>The nest is, moreover, well calculated for retaining any unpleasant
smell, being generally made in the hollow of a tree, and
having therefore but little of that thorough ventilation which is
found in nearly all nests which are built on boughs and sprays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>The food of the Hoopoe consists almost entirely of insects
They have been said to feed on earth-worms; but this notion
seems to be a mistaken one, as in captivity they will not touch
an earth-worm so long as they can procure an insect. Beetles of
various kinds seem to be their favourite food, and when the
beetles are tolerably large&mdash;say, for example, as large as the
common cockchafer and dor-beetle&mdash;the bird beats them into a
soft mass before it attempts to eat them. Smaller beetles are
swallowed without any ceremony. The various boring insects
which make their home in decaying wood are favourite articles
of diet with the Hoopoe, which digs them out of the soft wood
with its long curved beak.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that the nest is usually made
in the hollow of a tree. In many parts of the country however,
hollow trees cannot be found, and in that case the Hoopoe resorts
to clefts in the rock, or even to holes in old ruins.</p>

<p>The bird is a peculiarly conspicuous one, not only on account
of its boldly-barred plumage and its beautiful crest, but by its
cry and its gestures. It has a way of elevating and depressing
its crest, and bobbing its head up and down, in a manner which
could not fail to attract the attention even of the most incurious,
the whole aspect and expression of the bird varying with the
raising and depressing of the crest.</p>

<p>Respecting this crest there is a curious old legend. As is the
case with most of the Oriental legends, it introduces the name of
King Solomon, who, according to Oriental notions, was a mighty
wizard rather than a wise king, and by means of his seal, on
which was engraven the mystic symbol of Divinity, held sway
over the birds, the beasts, the elements, and even over the Jinns
and Afreets, <em>i.e.</em> the good and evil spirits, which are too ethereal
for the material world and too gross for the spiritual, and therefore
hold the middle place between them.</p>

<p>On one of his journeys across the desert, Solomon was perishing
from the heat of the sun, when the Hoopoes came to his aid,
and flew in a dense mass over his head, thus forming a shelter
from the fiery sunbeams. Grateful for this assistance, the
monarch told the Hoopoes to ask for a boon, and it should be
granted to them. The birds, after consulting together, agreed to
ask that from that time every Hoopoe should wear a crown
of gold like Solomon himself. The request was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
granted, and each Hoopoe found itself adorned with a royal
crown. At first, while their honours were new, great was the
joy of the birds, who paused at every little puddle of water to
contemplate themselves, bowing their heads over the watery
mirror so as to display the crown to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Soon, however, they found cause to repent of their ambition.
The golden crown became heavy and wearisome to them, and,
besides, the wealth bestowed on the birds rendered them the
prey of every fowler. The unfortunate Hoopoes were persecuted
in all directions for the sake of their golden crowns
which they could neither take off nor conceal.</p>

<p>At last, the few survivors presented themselves before Solomon,
and begged him to rescind his fatal gift, which he did by
substituting a crest of feathers for the crown of gold. The
Hoopoe, however, never forgets its former grandeur, and is
always bowing and bending itself as it used to do when contemplating
its golden crown in the water.</p>

<h2>THE SPARROW.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Sparrow upon the house top&mdash;Architecture
of the East&mdash;Little
birds exposed for sale in the market&mdash;The
two Sparrows sold for a
farthing&mdash;Bird-catching&mdash;The net, the snare, and the trap.</p></blockquote>


<p>We have already discussed the signification of the compound
word <em>tzippor-deror</em>, and will now take the word <em>tzippor</em> alone.</p>

<p>Like many other Hebrew terms, the word is evidently used in
a collective sense, signifying any small bird that is not specially
designated. In several portions of Scripture it is translated as
Sparrow, and to that word we will at present restrict ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>On turning to Ps. cii. 5-7, we find that the word is used as an
emblem of solitude and misery: "By reason of the voice of my
groaning, my bones cleave to my skin.</p>

<p>"I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of
the desert,</p>

<p>"I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house-top."</p>

<p>The word which is here translated as "Sparrow" is <em>tzippor</em>,
the same which is rendered as "bird" in Lev. xiv. 4. The
Hebrew Bible more consistently uses the collective term "bird"
in both instances, and renders the passage as, "I watch, and am
as a lonely bird upon a roof."</p>

<p>Now, any one who knows the habits of the Sparrow is perfectly
aware that it is a peculiarly sociable bird. It is quarrelsome
enough with its fellows, and always ready to fight for a
stray grain or morsel of food; but it is exceedingly gregarious,
assembling together in little parties, enlivening the air with its
merry though unmusical twitterings.</p>

<p>This cosmopolitan bird is plentiful in the coast towns of
Palestine, where it haunts the habitations of men with the same
dauntless confidence which it displays in this country. It is often
seen upon roofs or house-tops, but is no more apt to sit alone
in Palestine than it is here. On the contrary, the Sparrows
collect in great numbers on the house-tops, attracted by the
abundant supply of food which it finds there. This requires
some little explanation.</p>

<p>The house-tops of the East, instead of being gabled and tiled as
among ourselves, to allow the rain to run off, are quite flat, and
serve as terraces or promenades in the evening, or even for
sleeping-places; and from the house-tops proclamations were
made. See, for example, 1 Sam. ix. 25: "And when they were
come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed
with Saul upon the top of the house"&mdash;this being the ordinary
place which would be chosen for a conversation. In order to
keep out the heat of the mid-day sun, tents were sometimes
pitched upon these flat house-tops. (See 2 Sam. xvi. 22.) Reference
to the use of the house-tops as places for conversation
are made in the New Testament. See, for example, Matt. x. 27:
"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what
ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops." Another
passage of a similar nature occurs in Luke xii. 3: "Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the
light, and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall
be proclaimed on the house-tops."</p>

<p>These roofs, instead of being built with sloping rafters like
those to which we are accustomed in this country, are made
with great beams of wood laid horizontally, and crossed by
planks, poles, and brushwood packed tightly together. As this
roof would not keep out the rain, it is covered with a thick layer
of clay mixed with straw, and beaten down as hard as possible.
This covering has constantly to be renewed, as, even in the best
made roofs, the heavy rains are sure to wash away some portion
of the clay covering, which has to be patched up with a fresh
supply of earth. A stone roller is generally kept on the roof of
each house for the purpose of making a flat and even surface.</p>

<p>The earth which is used for this purpose is brought from the
uncultivated ground, and is full of various seeds. As soon as the
rains fall, these seeds spring up, and afford food to the Sparrows
and other little birds, who assemble in thousands on the house-tops,
and then peck away just as they do in our own streets and
farm-yards.</p>

<p>It is now evident that the "sparrow alone and melancholy
upon the house-tops" cannot be the lively, gregarious Sparrow
which assembles in such numbers on these favourite feeding-places.
We must therefore look for some other bird, and
naturalists are now agreed that we may accept the <span class="smcap">Blue Thrush</span>
(<em>Petrocossyphus cyaneus</em>) as the particular Tzippor, or small bird,
which sits alone on the house-tops.</p>

<p>The colour of this bird is a dark blue, whence it derives its
popular name. Its habits exactly correspond with the idea of
solitude and melancholy. The Blue Thrushes never assemble
in flocks, and it is very rare to see more than a pair together.
It is fond of sitting on the tops of houses, uttering its note, which,
however agreeable to itself, is monotonous and melancholy to a
human ear.</p>

<p>In connexion with the passage already quoted, "What ye
hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops," I will take
the opportunity of explaining the passage itself, which scarcely
seems relevant to the occasion unless we understand its bearings.
The context shows that our Lord was speaking of the new doctrines
which He had come to teach, and the duty of spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
them, and alludes to a mode of religious teaching which was
then in vogue.</p>

<p>The long captivity of the Jews in Babylon had caused the
Hebrew language to be disused among the common people, who
had learned the Chaldaic language from their captors. After
their return to Palestine, the custom of publicly reading the
Scriptures was found to be positively useless, the generality of
the people being ignorant of the Hebrew language.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="reading" id="reading"></a>
<img src="images/i_481.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="reading" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">READING THE LAW TO THE PEOPLE AFTER THE RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, the following modification was adopted. The
roll of the Scriptures was brought out as usual, and the sacred
words read, or rather chanted. After each passage was read, a
doctor of the law whispered its meaning into the ear of a Targumista
or interpreter, who repeated to the people in the Chaldaic
language the explanation which the doctor had whispered
in Hebrew. The reader will now see how appropriate is the
metaphor, the whispering in the ear and subsequent proclamation
being the customary mode of imparting religious instruction.</p>

<p>If the reader will now turn to Matt. x. 29, he will find that
the word "sparrow" is used in a passage which has become very
familiar to us. "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and
one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>

<p>"Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
sparrows." The same sentences are given by St. Luke (xii. 6), in
almost the same words.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="thrush" id="thrush"></a>
<img src="images/i_482.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="thrush" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BLUE THRUSH, OR SPARROW OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now the word which is translated as "Sparrow" is <em>strouthion</em>,
a collective word, signifying a bird of any kind. Without the
addition of some epithet, it was generally used to signify any
kind of small bird, though it is occasionally employed to signify
even so large a creature as an eagle, provided that the bird had
been mentioned beforehand. Conjoined with the word "great,"
it signifies the ostrich; and when used in connexion with a word
significative of running, it is employed as a general term for all
cursorial birds.</p>

<p>In the passages above quoted it is used alone, and evidently
signifies any kind of little bird, whether it be a sparrow or not.
Allusion is made by our Lord to a custom, which has survived
to the present day, of exposing for sale in the markets the bodies
of little birds. They are stripped of their feathers, and spitted
together in rows, and always have a large sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>Various birds are sold in this manner, little if any distinction
being made between them, save perhaps in respect of size, the
larger species commanding a higher price than the small birds.
In fact, they are arranged exactly after the manner in which the
Orientals sell their "kabobs," <em>i.e.</em> little pieces of meat pierced by
wooden skewers.</p>

<p>It is evident that to supply such a market it is necessary that
the birds should be of a tolerably gregarious nature, so that a
considerable number can be caught at a time. Nets were
employed for this purpose, and we may safely infer that the
forms of the nets and the methods of using them were identical
with those which are employed in the same country at the
present day.</p>

<p>The fowlers supply themselves with a large net supported on
two sticks, and, taking a lantern with them fastened to the top
of a pole, they sally out at night to the places where the small
birds sleep.</p>

<p>Raising the net on its sticks, they lift it to the requisite
height, and hold the lantern exactly opposite to it, so as to place
the net between the birds and the lantern. The roosting-places
are then beaten with sticks or pelted with stones, so as to
awaken the sleeping birds. Startled by the sudden noise, they
dash from their roosts, instinctively make towards the light, and
so fall into the net. Bird-catching with nets is several times
mentioned in the Old Testament, but in the New the net is only
alluded to as used for taking fish.</p>

<p>Beside the net, several other modes of bird-catching were used
by the ancient Jews, just as is the case at the present day.
Boys, for example, who catch birds for their own consumption,
and not for the market, can do so by means of various traps,
most of which are made on the principle of the noose, or snare.
Sometimes a great number of hair-nooses are set in places to
which the birds are decoyed, so that in hopping about many of
them are sure to become entangled in the snares. Sometimes
the noose is ingeniously suspended in a narrow passage which
the birds are likely to traverse, and sometimes a simple fall-trap
is employed.</p>

<p>We now pass to another division of the subject. In Ps. lxxxiv.
1-3, we come upon a passage in which the Sparrow is again
mentioned: "How amiable are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
Lord; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</p>

<p>"Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a
nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even Thine altars,
O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="treesparrow" id="treesparrow"></a>
<img src="images/i_484.jpg" width="400" height="323" alt="treesparrow" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE TREE-SPARROW, OR SPARROW OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is evident that we have in this passage a different bird
from the Sparrow that sitteth alone upon the house-tops; and
though the same word, <em>tzippor</em>, is used in both cases, it is clear
that whereas the former bird was mentioned as an emblem of
sorrow, solitude, and sadness, the latter is brought forward as an
image of joy and happiness. "Blessed are they," proceeds the
Psalmist, "that dwell in Thy house: they will be still praising
Thee.... For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand. I
had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to
dwell in the tents of wickedness."</p>

<p>According to Mr. Tristram, this is probably one of the species
to which allusion is made by the Psalmist. While inspecting
the ruins in the neighbourhood of the Temple, he came upon an
old wall. "Near this gate I climbed on to the top of the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
and walked along for some time, enjoying the fine view at the
gorge of the Kedron, with its harvest crop of little white tombs.
In a chink I discovered a sparrow's nest (<em>Passer cisalpinus</em>, var.)
of a species so closely allied to our own that it is difficult
to distinguish it, one of the very kind of which the Psalmist
sung.... The swallows had departed for the winter, but the
sparrow has remained pertinaciously through all the sieges and
changes of Jerusalem."</p>

<p>The same traveller thinks that the <span class="smcap">Tree Sparrow</span> (<em>Passer
montanus</em>) may be the species to which the sacred writer refers,
as it is even now very plentiful about the neighbourhood of the
Temple. In all probability we may accept both these birds as
representatives of the Sparrow which found a home in the
Temple. The swallow is separately mentioned, possibly because
its migratory habits rendered it a peculiarly conspicuous bird;
but it is probable that many species of birds might make their
nests in a place where they felt themselves secure from disturbance,
and that all these birds would be mentioned under the
collective and convenient term of Tzipporim.</p>

<h2>THE CUCKOO.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Cuckoo only twice mentioned in Scripture&mdash;The common species, and the Great
Spotted Cuckoo&mdash;Depositing the egg.</p></blockquote>


<p>Only in two instances is the word <span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span> found in the Authorized
Version of the Bible, and as they occur in parallel passages
they are practically reduced to one. In Lev. xi. 16 we find it
mentioned among the birds that might not be eaten, and the
same prohibition is repeated in Deut. xiv. 15, the Jews being
ordered to hold the bird in abomination.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable that the Arabic name for the bird is
exactly the same as ours, the peculiar cry having supplied the
name. Its habit of laying its eggs in the nests of other birds
is well known, together with the curious fact, that although so
large a bird, measuring more than a foot in length, its egg is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
larger than that of the little birds, such as the hedge-sparrow,
robin, or redstart.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GREAT SPOTTED CUCKOO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Besides this species, another Cuckoo inhabits Palestine, and
is much more common. This is the <span class="smcap">Great Spotted Cuckoo</span>
(<em>Oxylophus glandarius</em>). The birds belonging to this genus have
been separated from the other Cuckoos because the feathers on
the head are formed into a bold crest, in some species, such as
Le Vaillant's Cuckoo, reminding the observer of the crest of the
cockatoo. This fine bird measures nearly sixteen inches in
length, and can be distinguished, not only by the crested head,
but by the reddish grey of the throat and chest, and the white
tips of the wing and tail feathers.</p>

<p>This species lays its eggs in the nests of comparatively large
birds, such as the rooks, crows, and magpies.</p>

<h2>THE DOVE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Parallel between the lamb and the Dove&mdash;The Dove and the olive branch&mdash;Abram's
sacrifice, and its acceptance&mdash;The Dove-sellers of the Temple&mdash;The Rock Dove
and its multitudes.</p></blockquote>


<p>In giving the Scriptural history of the Doves and Pigeons, we
shall find ourselves rather perplexed in compressing the needful
information into a reasonable space. There is no bird which
plays a more important part, both in the Old and the New
Testaments, or which is employed so largely in metaphor and
symbol.</p>

<p>The Doves and Pigeons were to the birds what were the sheep
and lambs to the animals, and, like them, derived their chief
interest from their use in sacrifice. Both the lamb and the
young pigeon being emblems of innocence, both were used on
similar occasions, the latter being in many instances permitted
when the former were too expensive for the means of the offerer.
As to the rendering of the Hebrew words which have been
translated as Pigeon, Dove, and Turtle Dove, there has never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
been any discussion. The Hebrew word <em>yonâh</em> has always been
acknowledged to signify the Dove or Pigeon, and the word <em>tôr</em>
to signify the Turtle Dove. Generally, the two words are used
in combination, so that <em>tor-yonâh</em> signifies the Turtle Dove.</p>

<p>Though the interpretation of the word <em>yonâh</em> is universally
accepted, there is a little difficulty about its derivation, and its
signification apart from the bird. Some have thought that it is
derived from a root signifying warmth, in allusion to the warmth
of its affection, the Dove having from time immemorial been
selected as the type of conjugal love. Others, among whom is
Buxtorf, derive it from a word which signifies oppression, because
the gentle nature of the Dove, together with its inability to
defend itself, cause it to be oppressed, not only by man, but by
many rapacious birds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first passage in which we hear of the Dove occurs in the
earlier part of Genesis. Indeed, the Dove and the raven are the
first two creatures that are mentioned by any definite names,
the word <em>nachosh</em>, which is translated as "serpent" in Gen. iii. 1,
being a collective word signifying any kind of serpent, whether
venomous or otherwise, and not used for the purpose of designating
any particular species.</p>

<p>Turning to Gen. viii. 8, we come to the first mention of the
Dove. The whole passage is too familiar to need quoting, and
it is only needful to say that the Dove was sent out of the ark
in order that Noah might learn whether the floods had subsided,
and that, after she had returned once, he sent her out again
seven days afterwards, and that she returned, bearing an olive-branch
(or leaf, in the Jewish Bible). Seven days afterwards he
sent the Dove for the third time, but she had found rest on the
earth, and returned no more.</p>

<p>It is not within the province of this work to treat, except in
the most superficial manner, of the metaphorical signification of
the Scriptures. I shall, therefore, allude but very slightly to the
metaphorical sense of the passages which record the exit from
the ark and the sacrifice of Noah. Suffice it to say that, putting
entirely aside all metaphor, the characters of the raven and the
Dove are well contrasted. The one went out, and, though the
trees were at that time submerged, it trusted in its strong wings,
and hovered above the watery expanse until the flood had subsided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
The Dove, on the contrary, fond of the society of man,
and having none of the wild, predatorial habits which distinguish
the raven, twice returned to its place of refuge, before it was
finally able to find a resting-place for its foot.</p>

<p>After this, we hear nothing of the Dove until the time of
Abraham, some four hundred years afterwards, when the covenant
was made between the Lord and Abram, when "he believed
in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteousness." In
order to ratify this covenant he was ordered to offer a sacrifice,
which consisted of a young heifer, a she-goat, a ram, a turtle-dove,
and a young dove or pigeon. The larger animals were
severed in two, but the birds were not divided, and between the
portions of the sacrifice there passed a lamp of fire as a symbol
of the Divine presence.</p>

<p>In after days, when the promise that the seed of Abram
should be as the stars of heaven for multitude had been amply
fulfilled, together with the prophecy that they should be
"strangers in a land that was not theirs," and should be in
slavery and under oppression for many years, the Dove was
specially mentioned in the new law as one of the creatures that
were to be sacrificed on certain defined occasions.</p>

<p>Even the particular mode of offering the Dove was strictly
defined. See Lev. i. 14-17: "If the burnt sacrifice for his
offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering
of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.</p>

<p>"And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall
be wrung out at the side of the altar.</p>

<p>"And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
it beside the altar, on the east part, by the place of the ashes.</p>

<p>"And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar,
upon the wood that is upon the fire."</p>

<p>Here we have a repetition not only of the sacrifice of Abram,
but of the mode in which it was offered, care being taken that
the body of the bird should not be divided. There is a slight,
though not very important variation in one or two portions of
this passage. For example, the wringing off the head of the
bird is, literally, pinching off, and had to be done with the
thumb nail; and the passage which is by some translators rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
as the crop and the feathers, is by others translated as the
crop and its contents&mdash;a reading which seems to be more consonant
with the usual ceremonial of sacrifice than the other.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the pigeon was only sanctioned as a sacrificial
animal in case one of more value could not be afforded;
and so much care was taken in this respect, that with the
exception of the two "sparrows" (<em>tzipporim</em>) that were enjoined
as part of the sacrifice by which the cleansed leper was received
back among the people (Lev. xiv. 4), no bird might be offered
in sacrifice unless it belonged to the tribe of pigeons.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of the poverty of the family that the
Virgin Mary brought two young pigeons when she came to
present her new-born Son in the Temple. For those who were
able to afford it, the required sacrifice was a lamb of the first
year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or Turtle Dove for
a sin-offering. But "if she be not able to bring a lamb, then
she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, the one for
the burnt-offering and the other for a sin-offering." The extraordinary
value which all Israelites set upon the first-born son is
well known, both parents even changing their own names, and
being called respectively the father and mother of Elias, or
Joseph, as the case may be. If the parents who had thus
attained the summit of their wishes possessed a lamb, or could
have obtained one, they would most certainly have offered it in
the fulness of their joy, particularly when, as in the case of
Mary, there was such cause for rejoicing; and the fact that they
were forced to substitute a second pigeon for the lamb is a proof
of their extreme poverty.</p>

<p>While the Israelites were comparatively a small and compact
nation, dwelling around their tabernacle, the worshippers could
easily offer their sacrifices, bringing them from their homes
to the altar. But in process of time, when the nation had
become a large and scattered one, its members residing at great
distances, and only coming to the Temple once or twice in the
year to offer their sacrifices, they would have found that for even
the poor to carry their pigeons with them would have greatly
increased the trouble, and in many cases have been almost
impossible.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, therefore, a number of dealers
established themselves in the outer courts of the Temple, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the purpose of selling Doves to those who came to sacrifice.
Sheep and oxen were also sold for the same purpose, and, as
offerings of money could only be made in the Jewish coinage,
money-changers established themselves for the purpose of exchanging
foreign money brought from a distance for the legal
Jewish shekel. That these people exceeded their object, and
endeavoured to overreach the foreign Jews who were ignorant of
the comparative value of money and goods, is evident from the
fact of their expulsion by our Lord, and the epithets which were
applied to them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JESUS DRIVES OUT OF THE TEMPLE THE MONEY-CHANGERS AND THOSE WHO SOLD DOVES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>According to some old writers, the Dove was considered as
having a superiority over other birds in the instinctive certainty
with which it finds its way from one place to another.
At the present time, our familiarity with the variety of pigeon
known as the Carrier has taught us that the eye is the real
means employed by the pigeon for the direction of its flight.
Those who fly pigeons for long distances always take them
several times over the same ground, carrying them to an increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
distance at every journey, so that the birds shall be
able to note certain objects which serve them as landmarks.</p>

<p>Bees and wasps have recourse to a similar plan. When a
young wasp leaves its nest for the first time, it does not fly away
at once, but hovers in front of the entrance for some time, getting
farther and farther away from the nest until it has learned the
aspect of surrounding objects. The pigeon acts in precisely the
same manner, and so completely does it depend upon eyesight
that, if a heavy fog should come on, the best-trained pigeon will
lose its way.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="rockdove" id="rockdove"></a>
<img src="images/i_493.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="rockdove" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ROCK DOVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The old writers, however, made up their minds that the pigeon
found its way by scent, which sense alone, according to their
ideas, could guide it across the sea. They were not aware of the
power possessed by birds of making their eyes telescopic at will,
or of the enormous increase of range which the sight obtains by
elevation. A pigeon at the elevation of several hundred yards
can see to an astonishing distance, and there is no need of
imagining one sense to receive a peculiar development when the
ordinary powers of another are sufficient to obtain the object.</p>

<p>That dove-cotes were in use among the earlier Jews is well
known. An allusion to the custom of keeping pigeons in cotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
is seen in Isa. lx. 8: "Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as
the doves to their windows?" or, as the Jewish Bible translates
the passage, "as the doves to their apertures?" In this passage
the sacred writer utters a prophecy concerning the coming of the
world to the Messiah, the Gentiles flocking to Him as the clouds
of pigeons fly homeward to their cotes.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BLUE ROCK PIGEONS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The practice of pigeon-keeping has survived to the present day,
the houses of wealthy men being furnished with separate pigeon-houses
for the protection and shelter of these popular birds.</p>

<p>In the Holy Land are found all the species of Pigeons with
which we are familiar, together with one or two others. First,
there is the Rock Pigeon, or Blue Rock Dove, which is acknowledged
to be the origin of our domestic breeds of Pigeons,
with all their infinite variety of colour and plumage. This
species, though plentiful in Palestine, is not spread over the
whole of the land, but lives chiefly on the coast and in the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
parts of the country. In these places it multiplies in amazing
numbers, its increase being almost wholly unchecked by man,
on account of the inaccessible cliffs in which it lays its eggs
and nurtures its young, its only enemies being a few of the birds
and beasts of prey, which can exercise but a trifling influence
on these prolific birds.</p>

<p>Mr. Tristram, while visiting the Wady (or Valley) Seimûn,
which lies near the Lake of Gennesaret, witnessed an amusing
example of the vast number of these Pigeons.</p>

<p>"No description can give an adequate idea of the myriads of
rock pigeons. In absolute clouds they dashed to and fro in the
ravine, whirling round with a rush and a whirr that could be felt
like a gust of wind. It was amusing to watch them upset the
dignity and the equilibrium of the majestic griffon as they swept
past him. This enormous bird, quietly sailing along, was quite
turned on his back by the sudden rush of wings and wind."</p>

<p>In Palestine these birds are taken in nets, into which they are
decoyed by a very effective though cruel device.</p>

<p>When one of these birds is trapped or snared, it is seized by
its capturers, who spare its life for the sake of using it as a decoy.
They blind it by sewing its eyelids together, and then fasten it
to a perch among trees. The miserable bird utters plaintive
cries, and continually flaps its wings, thus attracting others of
its kind, who settle on the surrounding branches and are easily
taken, their whole attention being occupied by the cries of their
distressed companion.</p>

<p>We now come to the Turtle Doves, several of which inhabit
the Holy Land; but, as they are similar in habits, we will
confine ourselves to the common species, with which we are so
familiar in this country. Its migratory habits are noticed in the
sacred writings. See the following passage in the Song of Solomon:</p>

<p>"Lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the
flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is
come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land" (Cant.
ii. 11, 12). The prophet Jeremiah also refers to the migration of
this bird: "Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed
times; and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow observe
the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment
of the Lord" (viii. 7).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>Beside this species, there is the Collared Turtle Dove, one variety
of which is known as the Barbary Dove. It is a large species,
measuring more than a foot in length. Another species is the Palm
Turtle, so called from its habit of nesting on palm-trees, when it
is obliged to build at a distance from the habitations of man. It
is a gregarious bird, several nests being generally found on one
tree, and even, when it cannot find a palm, it will build among
the thorns in multitudes. Like the common Dove, it is fond of
the society of man, and is sure to make its nest among human
habitations, secure in its knowledge that it will not be disturbed.</p>

<h2>POULTRY.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Poultry plentiful in Palestine at the present day&mdash;The Domestic Fowl unknown
in the early times of Israel&mdash;The eating and gathering of eggs&mdash;References to
Poultry in the New Testament&mdash;The egg and the scorpion&mdash;The fatted fowl of
Solomon&mdash;The hen brooding over her eggs&mdash;Poultry prohibited within Jerusalem&mdash;The
cock-crowing.</p></blockquote>


<p>At the present day, poultry are plentiful both in Palestine and
Syria, and that they were bred in the time of the Apostles is
evident from one or two references which are made by our Lord.
How long the Domestic Fowl had been known to the Jews is
extremely uncertain, and we have very little to guide us in
our search.</p>

<p>That it was unknown to the Jews during the earlier period
of their history is evident from the utter silence of the Old
Testament on the subject. A bird so conspicuous and so plentiful
would certainly have been mentioned in the Law of Moses
had it been known to the Israelites; but, in all its minute and
detailed provisions, the Law is silent on the subject.</p>

<p>Neither the bird itself nor its eggs are mentioned, although
there are a few references to eggs, without signifying the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
which laid them. The humane provision in Deut. xxii. 6, 7, refers
not to a domesticated, but to a wild bird: "If a bird's nest
chance to be before thee in any tree, or on the ground, whether
they be young ones, or eggs, and the dams sitting upon the
young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the
young: but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the
young to thee; that it may be well with thee, that thou mayest
prolong thy days."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fowl" id="fowl"></a>
<img src="images/i_498.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="fowl" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE DOMESTIC FOWL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is but one passage in the Old Testament which has ever
been conjectured to refer to the Domestic Fowl. It occurs in
1 Kings iv. 22, 23: "And Solomon's provision for one day was
thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,</p>

<p>"Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and
fatted fowl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>Many persons think that the fatted fowl mentioned in the
above-quoted passage were really Domestic Fowl, which Solomon
had introduced into Palestine, together with various other birds
and animals, by means of his fleet. There may be truth in this
conjecture, but, as there can be no certainty, we will pass from
the Old Testament to the New.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the passages in which the Domestic
Fowl is mentioned in the New Testament. There is, for example,
that touching image employed by our Lord when lamenting over
Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often
would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth
gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!" The
reference is evidently made to the Domesticated Fowl, which in
the time of our Lord was largely bred in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Some writers have taken objection to this statement in consequence
of a Rabbinical law which prohibited poultry from
being kept within the walls of Jerusalem, lest in their search
for food they should scratch up any impurity which had been
buried, and so defile the holy city. But it must be remembered
that in the time of Christ Jerusalem belonged practically to the
Romans, who held it with a garrison, and who, together with
other foreigners, would not trouble themselves about any such
prohibition, which would seem to them, as it does to us, exceedingly
puerile, not to say unjustifiable.</p>

<p>That the bird was common in the days of our Lord is evident
from the reference to the "cock-crowing" as a measure of time.</p>

<h2>THE PEACOCK.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The foreign curiosities imported by Solomon&mdash;The word <em>Tucciyim</em> and its various
interpretations&mdash;Identity of the word with the Cingalese name of the Peacock&mdash;Reasons
why the Peacock should have been brought to Solomon&mdash;Its subsequent
neglect and extirpation.</p></blockquote>


<p>Among the many foreign objects which were imported by
Solomon into Palestine, we find that the Peacock is specially
mentioned. (See a passage which has already been mentioned
in connexion with ivory and apes.) The sacred historian, after
mentioning the ivory throne, the golden shields and targets,
that all the vessels in Solomon's house were of gold, and that
silver was so common as to be of no account, proceeds to give
the reason for this profuse magnificence. "For the king had at
sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three
years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory,
and apes, and peacocks" (1 Kings x. 22).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>That this magnificent bird should have been one of those
creatures that were imported by Solomon is almost certain.
It would be imported for the same reason as the apes;
namely, for the purpose of adding to the glories of Solomon's
house, and no bird could have been selected which would have
a more magnificent effect than the Peacock. Moreover, although
unknown in Palestine, it is extremely plentiful in India and
Ceylon, inhabiting the jungle by thousands, and, by a curious
coincidence, being invariably most plentiful in those spots which
are most frequented by tigers. In many parts of the country,
great numbers of Peacocks frequent the temples, and live
amicably with the sacred monkeys, passing their lives in absolute
security, protected by the sanctity of the place.</p>

<p>Their numbers, therefore, would render them easily accessible
to Solomon's envoys, who would purchase them at a cheap rate
from the native dealers, while their surpassing beauty would
render them sure of a sale on their arrival in Jerusalem.
Indeed, their beauty made so great an impression that they are
separately mentioned by the sacred chronicler, the Peacock and
the ape being the only two animals that are thought worthy of
enumeration.</p>

<p>The Peacock may safely be termed one of the most beautiful
of the feathered tribe, and may even lay a well-founded claim to
the chief rank among birds, in splendour of plumage and effulgence
of colouring.</p>

<p>We are so familiar with the Peacock that we think little of its
real splendour; but if one of these birds was brought to this
country for the first time, it would create a greater sensation than
many animals which are now viewed in menageries with the greatest
curiosity and interest.</p>

<p>The train of the male Peacock is the most remarkable feature
of this beautiful bird; the feathers composing it are very long, and
are coloured with green, purple, bronze, gold, and blue in such a
manner as to form distinct "eyes."</p>

<p>On the head is a tuft of upright feathers, blackish upon their
shafts, and rich golden green, shot with blue, on their expanded
tips. The top of the head, the throat, and neck are the most refulgent
blue, changing in different lights to gold and green. The
wings are darker than the rest of the plumage, the abdomen blackish,
and the feathers of the thighs are fawn.</p>

<p>The female is much smaller than her mate, and not nearly so
beautiful, the train being almost wanting, and the colour ashy-brown,
with the exception of the throat and neck, which are
green.</p>

<p>It seems that after Solomon's death the breed of Peafowl was
not kept up, owing in all probability to the troubles which beset
the throne after that magnificent monarch died.</p>

students of the Scriptures, both passages giving an insight into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
the manners and customs of the scarcely changing East. This
is the bird called in the Hebrew Kore, a word which has been
generally accepted as signifying some kind of Partridge. There
is no doubt that, like most other Hebrew names of animated
beings, the word is a collective one, signifying a considerable
number of species.</p>

<p>The first passage occurs in 1 Sam. xxvi. 20. When David was
being pursued by Saul, and had been forced to escape from the
city and hide himself in the rocky valleys, he compared himself
to the Partridge, which frequented exactly the same places:
"The king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one
doth hunt a partridge upon the mountains."</p>

<p>The appositeness of this simile is perfect. The bird to which
David alluded was in all probability the Desert Partridge
(<em>Ammoperdix Heyii</em>), a species which especially haunts rocky
and desert places, and even at the present day is exceedingly
plentiful about the Cave of Adullam. The males, when they
think themselves unobserved, are fond of challenging, or
calling to each other in a loud ringing note, a peculiarity
that has earned for the bird the Hebrew name of Kore, or
"the caller."</p>

<p>It is a very active bird, not taking to flight if it can escape
by means of its legs, and, when pursued or disturbed, running
with great swiftness to some rocky cleft in which it may hide
itself, taking care to interpose, as it runs, stones or other
obstacles between itself and the object of its alarm. Thus,
then, it will be seen how close was the parallel between this
bird and David, who was forced, like the Partridge, to seek for
refuge in the rocky caves.</p>

<p>But the parallel becomes even closer when we come to examine
the full meaning of the passage. The Partridge is at the present
day hunted on the mountains exactly as was the case in the
time of David. The usual hunters are boys, who provide themselves
with a supply of stout sticks about eighteen inches in
length, and, armed with these, they chase the birds, hurling the
sticks one after the other along the ground, so as to strike the
Partridge as it runs. Generally, several hunters chase the same
bird, some of them throwing the sticks along the ground, while
others hurl them just above the bird, so that if it should take to
flight, it may be struck as it rises into the air. By pertinaciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
chasing an individual bird, the hunters tire it, and contrive to
come so close that they are certain to strike it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GREEK PARTRIDGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The reader will now see how perfect is the image. Driven
from the city, David was forced to wander, together with the
Desert Partridge, upon the hill-sides, and, like that bird, his
final refuge is the rock. Then came the hunters and pursued
him, driving him from place to place, as the boys hunt the
Partridge, until he was weary of his life, and exclaimed in his
despair, "I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul."</p>

<p>The Partridges of Palestine are, like those of our own land,
exceedingly prolific birds, laying a wonderful number of eggs,
more than twenty being sometimes found in a single nest.
These eggs are used for food, and the consumption of them is
very great, so that many a Partridge has been deprived of her
expected family: she has sat upon eggs, and hatched them not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as hunting the Partridge is an acknowledged sport among
the inhabitants of the uncultivated parts of Palestine, so is searching
for the eggs of the bird a regular business at the proper time of year.</p>

<p>Of these birds several species inhabit Palestine. There is,
for example, the Desert Partridge, which has already been
mentioned. It is beautifully, though not brilliantly
coloured, and may be known by the white spot behind the eye,
the purple and chestnut streaks on the sides, and the orange bill
and legs. These, however, soon lose their colour after death.</p>

<h2>THE QUAIL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Migration of the Quail&mdash;Modes of catching the Quail in the East&mdash;The Quail-hunters
of Northern Africa&mdash;Quarrelsome nature of the bird&mdash;Quail-fighting in
the East&mdash;How the Quails were brought to the Israelites.</p></blockquote>


<p>In one or two parts of the Old Testament is found a word
which has been translated in the Authorized Version of the
Bible as <span class="smcap">Quail</span>.</p>

<p>The word is <em>selâv</em>, and in every case where it is mentioned it
is used with reference to the same occurrence; namely, the providing
of flesh-meat in the wilderness, where the people could
find no food. As the passages remarkably bear upon each other,
it will be advisable to quote them in the order in which they
come.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Selâv occurs in Exod. xvi. Only a
few days after the Israelites had passed the Red Sea, they began
to complain of the desert land into which Moses had led them,
and openly said that they wished they had never left the land
of their slavery, where they had plenty to eat. According to
His custom, pitying their narrow-minded and short-sighted folly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
the natural result of the long servitude to which they had been
subject, the Lord promised to send both bread and flesh-meat.</p>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel:
speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I
am the Lord your God.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="quail" id="quail"></a>
<img src="images/i_509.jpg" width="400" height="402" alt="quail" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE QUAIL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
covered the camp" (ver. 11-13).</p>

<p>The next passage records a similar circumstance, which
occurred about a year afterwards, when the Israelites were tired
of eating nothing but the manna, and again wished themselves
back in Egypt. "And there went forth a wind from the Lord,
and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's
journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were
two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p>"And the people stood up all that day, and all that night,
and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them
all abroad for themselves round about the camp" (Numb.
xi. 31, 32).</p>

<p>The last passage in which Quails are mentioned occurs in the
Psalms. In Ps. cv. are enumerated the various wonders done
on behalf of the Israelites, and among them is specially mentioned
this gift of the Quails and manna. "The people asked,
and He brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of
heaven" (ver. 40).</p>

<p>"He had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
doors of heaven,</p>

<p>"And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had
given them of the corn of heaven.</p>

<p>"Man did eat angels' food: He sent them meat to the full.</p>

<p>"He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven; and by His
power He brought in the south wind.</p>

<p>"He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
like as the sand of the sea" (Ps. lxxviii. 23-27).</p>

<p>If the ordinary interpretation of <em>selâv</em> by "Quail" be accepted,
the description is exactly correct. The Quails fly in vast flocks,
and, being weak-winged birds, never fly against the direction of
the wind. They will wait for days until the wind blows in the
required direction, and will then take wing in countless multitudes;
so that in an hour or two a spot on which not a Quail
could be seen is covered with them.</p>

<p>On account of their short wings, they never rise to any great
height, even when crossing the sea, while on land they fly at a
very low elevation, merely skimming over the ground, barely a
yard or "two cubits high upon the face of the earth."</p>

<p>Moreover, the flesh of the Quail is peculiarly excellent, and
would be a great temptation to men who had passed so long a
time without eating animal food. Another corroboration of the
identity of the Quail and the Selâv is to be found in the mode
in which the flesh is prepared at the present day. As soon as
the birds have arrived, they are captured in vast multitudes, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
account of their weariness. Many are consumed at once, but
great numbers are preserved for future use by being split and
laid out to dry in the sun, precisely as the Israelites are said to
have spread out the Selavim "all abroad for themselves round
about the camp."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Accepting, therefore, the Selâv and Quail to be identical, we
may proceed to the description of the bird.</p>

<p>It is small, plump, and round-bodied, with the head set
closely on the shoulders. Owing to this peculiarity of form, it
has its Arab name, which signifies plumpness or fatness. The
wings are pressed closely to the body, and the tail is pointed,
very short, and directed downwards, so that it almost appears to
be absent, and the bird seems to be even more plump than
really is the case.</p>

<p>Several modes of capturing these birds are still practised in
the East, and were probably employed, not only on the two
occasions mentioned in Exodus and Numbers, but on many
others of which the Scriptural narrative takes no notice. One
very simple plan is, for the hunters to select a spot on which the
birds are assembled, and to ride or walk round them in a large
circle, or rather in a constantly diminishing spiral. The birds
are by this process driven closer and closer together, until at the
last they are packed in such masses that a net can be thrown
over them, and a great number captured in it.</p>

<p>Sometimes a party of hunters unite to take the Quails, and
employ a similar man&oelig;uvre, except that, instead of merely
walking round the Quails, they approach simultaneously from
opposite points, and then circle round them until the birds are
supposed to be sufficiently packed. At a given signal they all
converge upon the terrified birds, and take them by thousands
at a time.</p>

<p>In Northern Africa these birds are captured in a very similar
fashion. As soon as notice is given that a flight of Quails has
settled, all the men of the village turn out with their great
burnouses or cloaks. Making choice of some spot as a centre,
where a quantity of brushwood grows or is laid down, the men
surround it on all sides, and move slowly towards it, spreading
their cloaks in their outstretched hands, and flapping them like
the wings of huge birds. Indeed, when a man is seen from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
little distance performing this act, he looks more like a huge bat
than a human being.</p>

<p>As the men gradually converge upon the brushwood, the
Quails naturally run towards it for shelter, and at last they all
creep under the treacherous shade. Still holding their outspread
cloaks in their extended hands, the hunters suddenly run
to the brushwood, fling their cloaks over it, and so enclose the
birds in a trap from which they cannot escape. Much care is
required in this method of hunting, lest the birds should take to
flight, and so escape. The circle is therefore made of very great
size, and the men who compose it advance so slowly that the
Quails prefer to use their legs rather than their wings, and do
not think of flight until their enemies are so close upon them
that their safest course appears to be to take refuge in the
brushwood.</p>

<p>Boys catch the Quails in various traps and springes, the most
ingenious of which is a kind of trap, the door of which over-balances
itself by the weight of the bird.</p>

<p>By reason of the colour of the Quail, and its inveterate habit
of keeping close to the ground, it easily escapes observation, and
even the most practised eye can scarcely distinguish a single
bird, though there may be hundreds within a very small compass.
Fortunately for the hunters, and unfortunately for itself, it
betrays itself by its shrill whistling note, which it frequently
emits, and which is so peculiar that it will at once direct the
hunter to his prey.</p>

<p>This note is at the same time the call of the male to the
female and a challenge to its own sex. Like all the birds of its
group, the Quail is very combative, and generally fights a battle
for the possession of each of its many mates. It is not gifted
with such weapons of offence as some of its kinsfolk, but it is none
the less quarrelsome, and fights in its own way as desperately as
the game-cock of our own country.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the East, it is used for exactly the same purpose as
the game-cock. Battles between birds and beasts, not to say
men, are the common amusement with Oriental potentates, and,
when they are tired of watching the combats of the larger
animals, they have Quail-fights in their own chambers. The
birds are selected for this purpose, and are intentionally furnished
with stimulating food, so as to render them even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
quarrelsome than they would be by nature. Partridges are
employed for the same cruel purpose; and as both these birds
are easily obtained, and are very pugnacious, they are especially
suited for the sport.</p>

<p>Two passages occur in the Scriptures which exactly explain
the mode in which the Quails were sent to the Israelites. The
first is in Ps. lxxviii. 26. The Psalmist mentions that the Lord
"caused an east wind to blow in the heaven, and by His power
He brought in the south wind." Here, on examining the geographical
position of the Israelites, we see exactly how the
south-east wind would bring the Quails.</p>

<p>The Israelites had just passed the Red Sea, and had begun to
experience a foretaste of the privations which they were to expect
in the desert through which they had to pass. Passing northwards
in their usual migrations, the birds would come to the
coast of the Red Sea, and there would wait until a favourable
wind enabled them to cross the water. The south-east wind
afforded them just the very assistance which they needed, and
they would naturally take advantage of it.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how closely the Scriptural narrative agrees
with the habits of the Quail, the various passages, when compared
together, precisely coinciding with the character of the
bird. In Exod. xvi. 13 it is mentioned that "at even the
quails came up and covered the camp." Nocturnal flight is one
of the characteristics of the Quail. When possible, they invariably
fly by night, and in this manner escape many of the
foes which would make great havoc among their helpless columns
if they were to fly by day.</p>

<p>The identity of the Selâv with the common Quail is now seen
to be established. In the first place, we have the name still
surviving in the Arabic language. Next, the various details of
the Scriptural narrative point so conclusively to the bird, that
even if we were to put aside the etymological corroboration, we
could have but little doubt on the subject. There is not a detail
which is not correct. The gregarious instinct of the bird, which
induces it to congregate in vast numbers; its habit of migration;
its inability to fly against the wind, and the necessity for it to
await a favourable breeze; its practice of flying by night, and its
custom of merely skimming over the surface of the ground; the
ease with which it is captured; the mode of preserving by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
drying in the sun, and the proverbial delicacy of its flesh, are
characteristics which all unite in the Quail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before closing our account of the Quail, it will be as well to
devote a short space to the nature of the mode by which
the Israelites were twice fed. Commentators who were
unacquainted with the natural history of the bird have
represented the whole occurrence as a miraculous one,
and have classed it with the division of the Red Sea
and of the Jordan, with the various plagues by which
Pharaoh was induced to release the Israelites, and with
many other events which we are accustomed
to call miracles.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 150px;"><a name="flight" id="flight"></a>
<img src="images/i_514.jpg" width="150" height="301" alt="flight" />
</div>

<p>In reality, there is scarcely anything of
a miraculous character about the event,
and none seems to have been claimed for
it. The Quails were not created at the
moment expressly for the purpose of supplying
the people with food, nor were they
even brought from any great distance.
They were merely assisted
in the business on which they
were engaged&mdash;namely, their migration
or customary travel from
south to north, and waiting on
the opposite side of the narrow
sea for a south-east wind. That
such a wind should blow was no
miracle. The Quails expected it to blow, and without it they
could not have crossed the sea. That it was made to blow
earlier than might have been the case is likely enough, but that
is the extent of the miraculous character of the event.</p>

<h2>THE RAVEN.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Raven tribe plentiful in Palestine&mdash;The Raven and the Dove&mdash;Elijah and the
Ravens&mdash;Desert-loving habits of the Raven&mdash;Notions of the old commentators&mdash;Ceremonial
use of the Raven&mdash;Return of the Ravens&mdash;Cunning of the bird&mdash;Nesting-places
of the Raven&mdash;The magpie and its character&mdash;The starling&mdash;Its
introduction into Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is more than probable that, while the Hebrew word <em>oreb</em>
primarily signifies the bird which is so familiar to us under the
name of <span class="smcap">Raven</span>, it was also used by the Jews in a much looser
sense, and served to designate any of the Corvidæ, or Crow tribe,
such as the raven itself, the crow, the rook, the jackdaw, and
the like. We will first take the word in its restricted sense, and
then devote a brief space to its more extended signification.</p>

<p>As might be expected from the cosmopolitan nature of the
Raven, it is very plentiful in Palestine, and even at the present
time is apparently as firmly established as it was in the days
when the various Scriptural books were written.</p>

<p>There are few birds which are more distinctly mentioned in
the Holy Scriptures than the Raven, though the passages in
which its name occurs are comparatively few. It is the first bird
which is mentioned in the Scriptures, its name occurring in
Gen. viii. 7: "And it came to pass at the end of forty days
that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made;</p>

<p>"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro
until the waters were dried up from off the earth."</p>

<p>Here we have, at the very outset, a characteristic account of
the bird. It left the ark, and flew to and fro, evidently for the
purpose of seeking food. The dove, which immediately followed
the Raven, acted in a different manner. She flew from the ark
in search of food, and, finding none, was forced to return again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
The Raven, on the contrary, would find plenty of food in the
bodies of the various animals that had been drowned, and were
floating on the surface of the waters, and, therefore, needed not
to enter again into the ark. The context shows that it made the
ark a resting-place, and that it "went forth to and fro," or, as
the Hebrew Bible renders the passage, "in going and returning,"
until the waters had subsided. Here, then, is boldly drawn the
distinction between the two birds, the carrion-eater and the
feeder on vegetable substances&mdash;a distinction to which allusion
has already been made in the history of the dove.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="raven" id="raven"></a>
<img src="images/i_516.jpg" width="400" height="415" alt="raven" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE RAVEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Passing over the declaration in Lev. xi. 15 and Deut. xiv. 14,
that every Raven (<em>i.e.</em> the Raven and all its tribe) is unclean, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
come to the next historical mention of the bird. This occurs in
1 Kings xvii. When Elijah had excited the anger of Ahab by
prophesying three years of drought, he was divinely ordered to
take refuge by the brook Cherith, one of the tributaries of the
Jordan. "And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook;
and I have commanded the ravens [<em>orebim</em>] to feed thee there.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="elijah" id="elijah"></a>
<img src="images/i_517.jpg" width="400" height="501" alt="elijah" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ELIJAH FED BY THE RAVENS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord:
for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before
Jordan.</p>

<p>"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the
brook."</p>

<p>In this passage we have a history of a purely miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
character. It is not one that can be explained away. Some
have tried to do so by saying that the banished prophet found
the nests of the Ravens, and took from them daily a supply of
food for his sustenance. The repetition of the words "bread
and flesh" shows that the sacred writer had no intention of
signifying a mere casual finding of food which the Ravens
brought for their young, but that the prophet was furnished with
a constant and regular supply of bread and meat twice in the
day. It is a statement which, if it be not accepted as the
account of a miracle, must be rejected altogether.</p>

<p>The desert-loving habit of the Raven is noticed in Isa. xxxiv.
11: "The cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
also and the raven shall dwell in it: and He shall stretch out
upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now pass to the notices of the Raven as given by
the writers and commentators of the Talmud.</p>

<p>Being an unclean bird, and one of ill omen, it was not permitted
to perch on the roof of the Temple. According to some
writers, it was kept off by means of scarecrows, and according
to others, by long and sharp iron spikes set so closely together
that there was no room for the bird to pass between them. The
latter is by far the more probable account, as the Raven is much
too cunning a bird to be deceived by a scarecrow for any length
of time. It might be alarmed at the first sight of a strange
object, but in a very short time it would hold all scarecrows in
supreme contempt.</p>

<p>Its carrion-eating propensities were well known to the ancient
writers, who must have had many opportunities of seeing the
Raven unite with the vultures in consuming the bodies, not only
of dead animals, but of warriors killed in battle. So fond was
the Raven of this food that, according to those writers, the very
smell of human blood attracted the bird; and, if a man accidentally
cut himself, or if he were bled for some illness, the
odour of the blood would bring round the spot all the Ravens
of the place.</p>

<p>The punctuality with which the Raven, in common with all
its kin, returns to its roosting-place, was also familiar to the
Talmudists, who made rather an ingenious use of this habit
The ceremonial law of the Jews required the greatest care in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
observing certain hours, and it was especially necessary to know
the precise time which marked the separation of one day from
another. This was ascertained easily enough as long as the day
was clear, but in case of a dull, murky day, when the course of
the sun could not be traced, some other plan was needed.</p>

<p>In the olden times, no artificial means of measuring time were
known, and the devout Jew was consequently fearful lest he
might unwittingly break the law by doing on one day an act
which ought to have been done on another. A convenient
method for ascertaining the time was, however, employed, and,
as soon as the Ravens, rooks, and similar birds were seen
returning to their homes, the sun was supposed to be setting.</p>

<p>This habit of returning regularly at the same time is mentioned
by Mr. Tristram in his "Land of Israel:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of all the birds of Jerusalem, the raven is decidedly the
most characteristic and conspicuous. It is present everywhere
to eye and ear, and the odours that float around remind us of
its use. On the evening of our arrival we were perplexed by
a call-note, quite new to us, mingling with the old familiar
croak, and soon ascertained that there must be a second species
of raven along with the common <em>Corvus corax</em>. This was the
African species (<em>Corvus umbrinus</em>, Hed.), the ashy-necked raven,
a little smaller than the world-wide raven, and here more
abundant in individuals.</p>

<p>"Beside these, the rook (<em>Corvus agricola</em>, Trist.), the common
grey, or hooded crow (<em>Corvus cornix</em>, L.), and the jackdaw
(<em>Corvus monedula</em>, L.), roost by hundreds in the sanctuary. We
used to watch them in long lines passing over our tents every
morning at daybreak, and returning in the evening, the rooks in
solid phalanx leading the way, and the ravens in loose order
bringing up the rear, generally far out of shot. Before retiring
for the night, popular assemblies of the most uproarious character
were held together in the trees of the Kedron and Mount
Olivet, and not until sunset did they withdraw in silence,
mingled indiscriminately, to their roosting-places on the walls.</p>

<p>"My companions were very anxious to obtain specimens of
these Jerusalem birds, which could only be approached as they
settled for the night; but we were warned by the Consul that
shooting them so close to the mosque might be deemed a sacrilege
by the Moslems, and provoke an attack by the guardians of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
Haram and the boys of the neighbourhood. They finally determined,
nevertheless, to run the risk; and stationing themselves
just before sunset in convenient hiding-places near the walls, at
a given signal they fired simultaneously, and, hastily gathering
up the spoils, had retreated out of reach, and were hurrying to
the tents before an alarm could be raised. The discharge of ten
barrels had obtained fourteen specimens, comprising five species.</p>

<p>Those who have tried to come within gunshot of a Raven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
can appreciate this anecdote, and can understand how the Raven
would ever afterwards keep clear of the spot where the flash and
smoke of fire-arms had twice appeared. In a large garden in
which the sparrows used to congregate, it was a custom of the owner
to lay a train of corn for the sparrows to eat, and then to rake
the whole line with a discharge from a gun concealed in an
outhouse. A tame Raven lived about the premises, and as soon
as it saw any one carrying a gun towards the fatal outhouse, it
became much alarmed, and hurried off to hide itself. As soon
as the gun was fired, out came the Raven from its place of concealment,
pounced on one of the dead sparrows, carried it off,
and ate it in its private haunt.</p>

<p>The nest to which the Raven returns with such punctuality
is placed in some spot where it is safe from ordinary intruders.
The tops of lofty trees are favoured localities for the nest, and
so are old towers, the interior of caves, and clefts in lofty precipices.</p>

<h2>THE OSTRICH.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Hebrew words designating the Ostrich&mdash;Description of the bird in the Book of Job&mdash;Ancient

of the Ostrich, and reference made to it in Micah.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is rather a peculiarity about the manner in which this
bird is mentioned in the Authorized Version of the Scriptures,
and, unless we go to the original Hebrew, we shall be greatly
misled. In that version the Ostrich is mentioned only three
times, but in the Hebrew it occurs eight times.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word <em>bath-haya'nah</em>, which is translated in the
Authorized Version as "owl," ought really to be rendered as
"Ostrich." Taking this to be the case, we find that there are
several passages in the Scriptures in which the word has been
used in the wrong sense.</p>

<p>In those places, instead of rendering the word as "owl," we
ought to read it as "Ostrich."</p>

<p>The first mention of this bird occurs in Lev. xi. 16, and the
parallel passage of Deut. xiv., in which the Ostrich is reckoned
among the unclean birds, without any notice being given of its
appearance or habits.</p>

<p>In the Book of Job, however, we have the Ostrich mentioned
with that preciseness and fulness of description which is so
often the case when the writer of that wonderful poem treats
of living creatures.</p>

<p>"Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings
and feathers unto the ostrich?</p>

<p>"Who leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in
the dust,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the
wild beast may break them.</p>

<p>"She is hardened against her young ones, as though they
were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</p>

<p>"Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath He
imparted to her understanding.</p>

<p>"What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
horse and his rider." (Job xxxix. 13-19.)</p>

<p>There is rather a peculiarity in the translation of this passage,
wherein the word which has been translated as "peacock" is
now allowed to be properly rendered as "Ostrich," while the
word which is translated as "Ostrich" ought to have been given
as "feathers." The marginal translation gives the last words of
ver. 13 in a rather different manner, and renders it thus:&mdash;"Gavest
thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks, or the feathers
of the stork and ostrich?" The Hebrew Bible renders the next
verses as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She would yet leave her eggs on the earth, and warm them
in dust; and forget that the foot may crush them, or that the
beast of the field may break them.</p>

<p>"She is hardened against her young ones, for those not hers;
being careless, her labour is in vain."</p>

<p>In the same Book, chap. xxx., is another passage wherein this
bird is mentioned. "I went mourning without the sun: I stood
up, and I cried in the congregation.</p>

<p>"I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls," or
Ostriches, in the marginal and correct reading. The Jewish
Bible also translates the word as Ostriches, but the word which
the Authorized Version renders as "dragons" it translates as
"jackals." Of this point we shall have something to say on a
future page. A somewhat similar passage occurs in Isa. xliii.
20: "The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and
the owls" (Ostriches in marginal reading), "because I give
waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink
to My people, My chosen." The Jewish Bible retains the same
reading, except that the word "dragons" is given with the mark
of doubt.</p>

<p>Accepting, therefore, the rendering of the Hebrew as Ostriches,
let us see how far the passages of Scripture agree with the
appearance and habits of the bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>Here I may observe that, although in the Scriptures frequent
allusions are made to the habits of animals, we are not to look
for scientific exactness to the Scriptures. Among much that is
strictly and completely true, there are occasional errors, to which
a most needless attention has been drawn by a certain school of
critics, who point to them as invalidating the truth of Scripture
in general. The real fact is, that they have no bearing whatever
on the truth or falsehood of the Scriptural teachings.</p>

<p>The Scriptures were written at various times, for instruction
in spiritual and not in temporal matters, and were never
intended for scientific treatises on astronomy, mathematics,
zoology, or any such branch of knowledge. The references
which are made to the last-mentioned subject are in no case of
a scientific nature, but are always employed by way of metaphor
or simile, as the reader must have seen in the previous pages. No
point of doctrine is taught by them, and none depends on them.</p>

<p>The Spirit which conveyed religious instruction to the people
could only use the means that existed, and could no more employ
the scientific knowledge of the present time than use as metaphors
the dress, arms, and inventions of the present day. The
Scriptures were written in Eastern lands for Orientals by
Orientals, and were consequently adapted to Oriental ideas; and
it would be as absurd to look for scientific zoology in the writings
of an ancient Oriental, as for descriptions of the printing-press,
the steam-engine, the photographic camera, or the electric
telegraph.</p>

<p>So, when we remember that only a few years ago the real
history of the Ostrich was unknown to those who had made
zoology the study of their lives, we cannot wonder that it was
also unknown to those who lived many centuries ago, and who
had not the least idea of zoology, or any kindred science.</p>

<p>Still, even with these drawbacks, it is wonderful how accurate
in many instances were the writers of the Scriptures, and the
more so when we remember the character of the Oriental mind,
with its love of metaphor, its disregard of arithmetical precision,
and its poetical style of thought.</p>

<p>We will now take the passage in Job xxxix. In ver. 13
reference is made to the wings and feathers of the Ostrich. If
the reader will refer to page 310, he will see that the feathers of
the Ostrich were formerly used as the emblem of rank. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
case, they are shown as fastened to the heads of the horses, and
also in the form of a plume, fixed to the end of a staff, and
appended to a chariot, as emblematical of the princely rank of
the occupier. In the ancient Egyptian monuments these Ostrich
plumes are repeatedly shown, and in every case denote very high
rank. These plumes were therefore held in high estimation at
the time in which the Book of Job was written, and it is
evidently in allusion to this fact that the sacred writer has
mentioned so prominently the white plumes of the Ostrich.</p>

<p>Passing the next portion of the description, we find that the
Ostrich is mentioned as a bird that is careless of its eggs, and
leaves them "in the earth, and warmeth them in the dust, and
forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast
may break them."</p>

<p>Now it is true that the Ostrich is often known to take the
greatest care of its eggs, the male collecting and sitting on
them, and watching them with loving assiduity, and by some
persons this fact has been brought forward as a proof that the
writer of the Book of Job was mistaken in his statements. A
further acquaintance with the habits of the bird tells us, however,
that in those parts of the world which were known to the
writer of that book the Ostrich does behave in precisely the
manner which is described by the sacred writer.</p>

<p>Several females lay their eggs in the same nest, if the title of
nest can be rightly applied to a mere hollow scooped in the
sand, and, at least during the daytime, when the sun is shining,
they simply cover the eggs with sand, so as to conceal them from
ordinary enemies, and leave them to be hatched by the warm
sunbeams. They are buried to the depth of about a foot, so
that they receive the benefit of a tolerably equable warmth. So
much, then, for the assertion that the Ostrich leaves her eggs
"in the earth, and warmeth them in the dust."</p>

<p>We next come to the statement that she forgets that "the foot
may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them." It is
evident from the preceding description that eggs which are
buried a foot deep in the sand could not be crushed by the foot,
even were they of a fragile character, instead of being defended
by a shell as thick, and nearly as hard, as an ordinary earthenware
plate. Neither would the wild beast be likely to discover
much less to break them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="ostrich" id="ostrich"></a>
<img src="images/i_526.jpg" width="400" height="401" alt="ostrich" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">OSTRICH AND NEST.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A more intimate acquaintance with the history of the Ostrich
shows that, even in this particular, the sacred writer was perfectly
correct. Besides the eggs which are intended to be
hatched, and which are hidden beneath the sand to be hatched,
a number of supplementary eggs are laid which are not meant
to be hatched, and are evidently intended as food for the young
until they are able to forage for themselves. These are left
carelessly on the surface of the ground, and may easily be
crushed by the hoof of a horse, if not by the foot of man. We
meet, however, with another statement,&mdash;namely, that they may
be broken by the wild beasts. Here we have reference to
another fact in the history of the Ostrich. The scattered eggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
to which allusion is made, are often eaten, not only by beasts,
but also by birds of prey; the former breaking the shells by
knocking them against each other, and the latter by picking up
large stones in their claws, rising above the eggs, and dropping
the stones on them. The bird would like to seize the egg, rise
with it in the air, and drop it on a stone, as mentioned on page
414, but the round, smooth surface of the egg defies the grasp of
talons, and, instead of dropping the egg upon a stone, it is
obliged to drop a stone upon the egg.</p>

<p>Up to the present point, therefore, the writer of the Book of
Job is shown to be perfectly correct in his statements. We
will now proceed to verse 16: "She is hardened against her
young ones, as though they were not hers." Now in the Jewish
Bible the passage is rendered rather differently: "She is hardened
against her young ones, for those not hers;" and, as we
shall presently see, the reading perfectly agrees with the character
of the Ostrich.</p>

<p>There has long existed a belief that the Ostrich, contrary to
the character of all other birds, is careless of her young, neglects
them, and is even cruel to them. That this notion was shared
by the writer of the Book of Job is evident from the preceding
passage. It also prevailed for at least a thousand years after
the Book of Job was written. See Lam. iv. 3: "Even the sea
monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young
ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the
ostriches in the wilderness."</p>

<p>It is probable that this idea respecting the cruelty of the
Ostrich towards its young is derived from the fact that if a flock
of Ostriches be chased, and among them there be some very
young birds, the latter are left behind by their parents, and fall
a prey to the hunters. But, in reality, the Ostrich has no choice
in the matter. The wide sandy desert affords no place of concealment
in which it might hide its young. Nature has not
furnished it with weapons by means of which it can fight for
them; and consequently it is forced to use the only means of
escape by which it can avoid sacrificing its own life, as well as
the lives of the young.</p>

<p>It does not, however, leave the young until it has tried, by all
means in its power, to save them. For example, it sometimes
has recourse to the man&oelig;uvre with which we are so familiar in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
the case of the lapwing, and pretends to be wounded or lamed,
in order to draw the attention of its pursuers, while its young
escape in another direction. An instance of this practice is
given by Mr. Andersson in his "Lake Ngami." "When we had
proceeded little more than half the distance, and in a part of the
plain entirely destitute of vegetation, we discovered a male and
female ostrich, with a brood of young ones, about the size of
ordinary barn-yard fowls. We forthwith dismounted from out
oxen, and gave chase, which proved of no ordinary interest.</p>

<p>"The moment the parent birds became aware of our intention,
they set off at full speed&mdash;the female leading the way, and the
cock, though at some little distance, bringing up the rear of the
family party. It was very touching to observe the anxiety the
birds evinced for the safety of their progeny. Finding that we
were quickly gaining upon them, the male at once slackened his
pace and diverged somewhat from his course; but, seeing that we
were not to be diverted from our purpose, he again increased his
speed, and, with wings drooping so as almost to touch the ground,
he hovered round us, now in wide circles, and then decreasing
the circumference until he came almost within pistol-shot, when
he abruptly threw himself on the ground, and struggled desperately
to regain his legs, as it appeared, like a bird that has been
badly wounded.</p>

<p>"Having previously fired at him, I really thought he was disabled,
and made quickly towards him. But this was only a
ruse on his part, for, on my nearer approach, he slowly rose, and
began to run in a different direction to that of the female, who
by this time was considerably ahead with her charge." Nor is
this a solitary instance of the care which the Ostrich will take of
her young. Thunberg mentions that on one occasion, when he
happened to ride near a place where an Ostrich was sitting on
the eggs, the bird jumped up and pursued him, evidently with
the object of distracting his attention from the eggs. When he
faced her, she retreated; but as soon as he turned his horse, she
pursued him afresh.</p>

<p>The care of the mother for the young is perhaps less needed
with the Ostrich than with most birds. The young are able to
run with such speed that ordinary animals are not able to overtake
them, and, besides, they are protected by their colour as
long as they are comparatively helpless. Their downy plumage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
harmonizes completely with the sandy and stony ground, even
when they run, and when they crouch to the earth, as is their
manner when alarmed, even the most practised eye can scarcely
see them. Mr. Andersson, an experienced hunter, states that
when the Ostrich chicks were crouching almost under his feet,
he had the greatest difficulty in distinguishing their forms.</p>

<p>Owing to the great number of the eggs that are laid, the young
are often very numerous, between thirty and forty chicks sometimes
belonging to one brood. In the Ostrich chase which has
already been described, the brood were eighteen in number, and
so great was their speed that, in spite of their youth and diminutive
size, Mr. Andersson only succeeded in capturing nine of
them after an hour's severe chase.</p>

<p>We find, therefore, that we must acquit the Ostrich of neglecting
its young, much more of cruelty towards them; and we will
now turn to the next charge against the bird, that of stupidity.</p>

<p>In one sense, the bird certainly may be considered stupid.
Like nearly all wild creatures which live on large plains, it
always runs against the wind, so as to perceive by scent if any
enemies are approaching. Its nostrils are very sensitive, and
can detect a human being at a very great distance. So fastidious
is it in this respect, that no hunter who knows his business ever
attempts to approach the Ostrich except from leeward. If a
nest is found, and the discoverer wishes the birds to continue
laying in it, he approaches on the leeward side, and rakes out
the eggs with a long stick.</p>

<p>The little Bushman, who kills so many of these birds with
his tiny bow and arrow, makes use of this instinct when he goes
to shoot the Ostrich, disguised in a skin of one of the birds.
Should an Ostrich attack him, as is sometimes the case, he only
shifts his position to windward, so as to allow the birds to catch
the scent of a human being, when they instantly make off in
terror.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Ostriches are alarmed, they always run
to windward, instinctively knowing that, if an enemy should
approach in that direction, their powers of scent will inform
them of the danger. Being aware of this habit, the hunters
manage so that while one of them goes round by a long detour
to frighten the game, the others are in waiting at a considerable
distance to windward, but well on one side, so that no indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
of their presence may reach the sensitive nostrils of the birds.
As soon as the concealed hunters see the Ostriches fairly settled
down to their course, they dash off at right angles to the line
which the birds are taking, and in this way come near enough
to use their weapons. The antelopes of the same country have
a similar instinct, and are hunted in precisely the same manner.</p>

<p>Thus, then, in one sense the Ostrich may be considered as
open to the charge of stupidity, inasmuch as it pursues a course
which can be anticipated by enemies who would otherwise be
unable to overtake it. But it must be remembered that instinct
cannot be expected to prove a match for reason, and that,
although its human enemies are able to overreach it, no others
can do so, the instinct of running against the wind serving to
guard it from any foe which it is likely to meet in the desert.</p>

<p>When captured alive and tamed, it certainly displays no particular
amount of intellect. The Arabs often keep tame Ostriches
about their tents, the birds being as much accustomed to their
quarters as the horses. In all probability they did so in ancient
times, and the author of the Book of Job was likely to be
familiar with tame Ostriches, as well as with the wild bird.</p>

<p>Stupidity is probably attributed to the tame bird in consequence
of the habit possessed by the Ostrich of picking up and
eating substances which cannot be used as food. For example,
it will eat knives, bits of bone or metal, and has even been
known to swallow bullets hot from the mould. On dissecting
the digestive organs of an Ostrich, I have found a large quantity
of stones, pieces of brick, and scraps of wood. These articles
are, however, not intended to serve as food, but simply to aid
digestion, and the bird eats them just as domestic fowls pick up
gravel, and smaller birds grains of sand. In swallowing them,
therefore, the Ostrich does not display any stupidity, but merely
obeys a natural instinct.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the speed of the Ostrich: "What time
she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his
rider."</p>

<p>This statement is literally true. When the Ostrich puts forth
its full speed, there is no horse that can catch it in a fair chase.
It may be killed by the ruse which has already been described,
but an adult Ostrich can run away from the swiftest horse.
When it runs at full speed, it moves its long legs with astonishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
rapidity, covering at each stride an average of twenty-four
feet, a fact from which its rate of speed may be deduced. In
consequence of this width of stride, and the small impression
made in the sand by the two-toed foot, the track of a running
Ostrich is very obscure. Perhaps no better proof of the swiftness
of the bird can be given than the extreme value set upon
it by the Arabs. Although they are bred to the desert as much
as the Ostrich itself, and are mounted on horses whose swiftness
and endurance are proverbial, they set a very high value on the
Ostrich, and to have captured one of these birds establishes an
Arab's fame as a hunter.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Arabs employ the plan of cutting across the
course of the bird, but at others they pursue it in fair chase,
training their horses and themselves specially for the occasion.
They furnish themselves with a supply of water, and then start
in pursuit of the first flock of Ostriches they find. They take
care not to alarm the birds, lest they should put out their full
speed and run away out of sight, but just keep sufficiently near
to force the birds to be continually on the move. They will
sometimes continue this chase for several days, not allowing
their game time to eat or rest, until at last it is so tired that it
yields itself an easy prey.</p>

<p>In Southern Africa, snares are used for taking the Ostrich.
They are in fact ordinary springes, but of strength suitable to the
size of the bird. The cord is made fast to a sapling, which is
bent down by main strength, and the other end is then formed
into a noose and fastened down with a trigger. Sometimes the
bird is enticed towards the snare by means of a bait, and sometimes
it is driven over it by the huntsmen. In either case, as
soon as the Ostrich puts its foot within the fatal noose, the
trigger is loosed, the sapling is released, and, with a violent jerk,
the Ostrich is caught by the leg and suspended in the air.</p>

<p>Why the flesh of the Ostrich should have been prohibited to
the Jews is rather a mystery. It is much valued by most
natives, though some of the Arab tribes still adhere to the
Jewish prohibition, and those Europeans who have tried it pronounce
it to be excellent when the bird is young and tender, but
to be unpleasantly tough when it is old. Mr. Andersson says
that its flesh resembles that of the zebra, and mentions that the
fat and blood are in great request, being mixed together by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a><br /><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
cutting the throat of the bird, passing a ligature round the neck
just below the incision, and then shaking and dragging the bird
about for some time. Nearly twenty pounds of this substance
are obtained from a single Ostrich.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 330px;"><a name="arabs" id="arabs"></a>
<img src="images/i_532.jpg" width="330" height="600" alt="arabs" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ARABS HUNTING THE OSTRICH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ancient Romans valued exceedingly the flesh of this bird.
We are told that Heliogabalus once had a dish served at his
table containing six hundred Ostrich brains, and that another
emperor ate a whole Ostrich at a meal. As an adult Ostrich
weighs some three hundred and fifty pounds, we may presume that
the bird in question was a young one.</p>

<p>The eggs are most valuable articles of food, both on account of
their excellent flavour and their enormous size. It is calculated
that one Ostrich egg contains as much as twenty-five ordinary
hen's eggs. Cooking the Ostrich egg is easily performed. A
hole is made in the upper part of the egg, and the lower end is
set on the fire. A forked stick is then introduced into the egg,
and twirled between the hands, so as to beat up the whole of
the interior. Europeans usually add pepper and salt, and
say that this simple mode of cooking produces an excellent
omelette.</p>

<p>The ordinary food of the Ostrich consists of the seeds, buds,
and tops of various plants. It seems strange, however, that in
the deserts, where there is so little vegetation, the bird should be
able to procure sufficient food to maintain its enormous body.
Each of the specimens which are kept at the Zoological Gardens
eats on an average a pint of barley, the same quantity of oats,
four pounds' weight of cabbage, and half a gallon of chaff,
beside the buns, bread, and other articles of food which are
given to them by visitors.</p>

<p>Although the Ostrich, like many other inhabitants of the
desert, can live for a long time without water, yet it is forced to
drink, and like the camel, which it resembles in so many of its
ways, drinks enormously, taking in the water by a succession
of gulps. When the weather has been exceptionally hot, the
Ostrich visits the water-springs daily, and is so occupied in
quenching its thirst that it will allow the hunter to come within
a very short distance. It appears, indeed, to be almost intoxicated
with its draught, and, even when it does take the alarm, it
only retreats step by step, instead of scudding off with its
usually rapid strides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>The camel-like appearance of the Ostrich has already been
mentioned. In the Arabic language the Ostrich is called by a
name which signifies camel-bird, and many of the people have
an idea that it was originally a cross between a bird and a
camel.</p>

<p>The cry of the Ostrich is a deep bellow, which, according to
travellers in Southern Africa, so resembles the roar of the lion
that even the practised ears of the natives can scarcely distinguish
the roar of the animal from the cry of the bird. The resemblance
is increased by the fact that both the lion and Ostrich
utter their cry by night. It is evidently to this cry that the
prophet Micah alludes: "Therefore I will wail and howl, I
will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the
dragons, and mourning as the owls" (Ostriches in marginal reading).
The cry of the variety of Ostrich which inhabits Northern
Africa is said to bear more resemblance to the lowing of an ox
than the roar of the lion; but as the bird is smaller than its
southern relative, the difference is probably accounted for.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the Ostrich has no weapons
wherewith to fight for its young; still, though it be destitute of
actual weapons, such as the spur of the gamecock or the beak
and talons of the eagle, it is not entirely defenceless. Its long
and powerful legs can be employed as weapons, and it can kick
with such force that a man would go down before the blow, and
probably, if struck on the leg or arm, have the limb broken.
The blow is never delivered backward, as is the kick of the
horse, but forward, like that of the kangaroo. The natives of
the countries where it resides say that it is able to kill by its kick
the jackal that comes to steal its eggs, and that even the hyæna
and the leopard are repelled by the gigantic bird.</p>

the Bittern in its haunts&mdash;Mudie's description of the Bittern and its home&mdash;Nest
of the Bittern&mdash;Scarcity of the bird at the present day&mdash;Food of the
Bittern.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Bittern belongs to the same family as the herons, the
cranes, and the storks, and has many of the habits common to
them all. It is, however, essentially a bird of solitude, hating
the vicinity of man, and living in the most retired spots of
marshy ground. As it sits among the reeds and rushes, though
it is a large bird, it is scarcely visible even to a practised eye, its
mottled plumage harmonizing with surrounding objects in such a
way that the feathers of the bird can scarcely be distinguished
from the sticks, stones, and grass tufts among which it sits. The
ground colour of the plumage is dark buff, upon which are
sprinkled mottlings and streaks of black, chestnut, grey, and
brown. These mottled marks harmonize with the stones and
tufts of withered grass, while the longitudinal dashes of buff
and black on the neck and breast correspond with the sticks and
reeds.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the tiger, though so large an animal, can
lie in a very small covert of reeds without being detected, its
striped fur corresponding with the reeds themselves and the
shadows thrown by them; and the leopard can remain hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
among the boughs of a tree, its spotted coat harmonizing with
the broken light and shade of the foliage.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="bittern" id="bittern"></a>
<img src="images/i_536.jpg" width="400" height="482" alt="bittern" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BITTERN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The following powerful description of the Bittern's home is
given by Mudie: "It is a bird of rude nature, where the land
knows no character save that which the untrained, working of
the elements impresses upon it; so that when any locality is in
the course of being won to usefulness, the bittern is the first to
depart, and when any one is abandoned, it is the last to return.
'The bittern shall dwell there' is the final curse, and implies
that the place is to become uninhabited and uninhabitable. It
hears not the whistle of the ploughman, nor the sound of the
mattock; and the tinkle of the sheep-bell, or the lowing of the
ox (although the latter bears so much resemblance to its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
hollow and dismal voice, that it has given foundation to the
name), is a signal for it to be gone.</p>

<p>"Extensive and dingy pools&mdash;if moderately upland, so much
the better&mdash;which lie in the hollows, catching, like so many
traps, the lighter and more fertile mould which the rains wash
and the winds blow from the naked heights around, and converting
it into harsh and dingy vegetation, and the pasture of
those loathsome things which wriggle in the ooze, or crawl and
swim in the putrid and mantling waters, are the habitation of
the bittern.</p>

<p>"Places which scatter blight and mildew over every herb
which is more delicate than a sedge, a carex, or a rush, and
consume every wooded plant that is taller than the sapless and
tasteless cranberry or the weeping upland willow; which shed
murrain over the quadrupeds, chills which eat the flesh off their
bones, and which, if man ventures there, consume him by putrid
fever in the hot and dry season, and shake him to pieces with
ague when the weather is cold and humid.</p>

<p>"Places from which the heath and the lichen stand aloof, and
where even the raven, lover of disease, and battener upon all
that expires miserably and exhausted, comes rarely and with
more than wonted caution, lest that death which he comes to
seal and riot upon in others should unawares come upon himself.
The raven loves carrion on the dry and unpoisoning moor,
scents it from afar, and hastens to it upon his best and boldest
wing; but 'the reek o' the rotten fen' is loathsome to the sense
of even the raven, and it is hunger's last pinch ere he come nigh
to the chosen habitation, the only loved abode, of the bittern."</p>

<p>Secure in its retreat, the Bittern keeps its place even if a
sportsman should pass by the spot on which it crouches. It
will not be tempted to leave its retreat by noise, or even by stone
throwing, for it knows instinctively that the quaking bogland
which it selects as its home is unsafe for the step of man.</p>

<p>The very cry of the Bittern adds to this atmosphere of desolation.
By day the bird is silent, but after the sun has gone
down it utters its strange wild cry, a sound which exactly suits
the localities in which it loves to make its habitation. During
part of the year it only emits a sharp, harsh cry as it rises on
the wing, but during the breeding season it utters the cry by
which it summons its mate, one of the strangest love-calls that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a><br /><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
can be imagined. It is something between the neighing of a
horse, the bellow of a bull, and a shriek of savage laughter. It
is very loud and deep, so that it seems to shake the loose and
marshy ground. There was formerly an idea that, when the
Bittern uttered this booming cry, it thrust its bill into the soft
ground, and so caused it to shake. In reality, the cry is uttered
on the wing, the bird wheeling in a spiral flight, and modulating
its voice in accordance with the curves which it describes in
the air. This strange sound is only uttered by the male bird.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 335px;"><a name="cormorant" id="cormorant"></a>

BITTERN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CORMORANT.<br />
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Like most of the long-legged wading birds, the Bittern is able
to change its shape, and apparently to alter its size, in an astonishing
manner. When it is walking over the ground, with
head erect and eye glanced vigilantly at surrounding objects, it
looks a large, bold, vigorous, and active bird. Next minute it
will sink its head in its shoulders, so that the long beak seems to
project from them, and the neck totally disappears, the feathers
enveloping each other as perfectly and smoothly as if it never
had had a neck. In this attitude it will stand for an hour at a
time on one leg, with the other drawn close to its body, looking
as dull, inert, and sluggish a bird as can well be imagined, and
reduced apparently to one half of its former size. The Bittern
is represented in one of its extraordinary attitudes on the plate
which illustrates the cormorant.</p>

<p>The nest of the Bittern is placed on the ground, and near the
water, though the bird always takes care to build it on an
elevated spot which will not be flooded if the water should rise
by reason of a severe rain. There is, however, but little reason
for the Bittern to fear a flood, as at the time of year which is
chosen for nest-building the floods are generally out, and the
water higher than is likely to be the case for the rest of the
year. The materials of the nest are found in marshes, and
consist of leaves, reeds, and rushes.</p>

<p>As if to add to the general effect of its character, it is essentially
a solitary bird, and in this characteristic entirely unlike its
relatives the heron and the stork, which are peculiarly sociable,
and love to gather themselves together in multitudes. But the
Bittern is never found except alone, or at the most accompanied
for a time by its mate and one or two young ones.</p>

<p>The localities in which it resides are sufficient evidence of
the nature of its food. Frogs appear to be its favourite diet, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
it also feeds on various fish, insects, molluscs, worms, and similar
creatures. Dull and apathetic as it appears to be, it can display
sufficient energy to capture tolerably large fish. Though the
Bittern is only about two feet in total length, one of these birds
was killed, in the stomach of which were found one perfect rudd
eight inches in length and two in depth, together with the remains
of another fish, of a full-grown frog, and of an aquatic
insect. In another instance, a Bittern had contrived to swallow
an eel as long as itself; while in many cases the remains of five
or six full-grown frogs have been found in the interior of the
bird, some just swallowed, and others in various stages of
digestion.</p>

<h2>THE HERON.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Heron mentioned as an unclean bird&mdash;Nesting of the Heron&mdash;The papyrus
marshes and their dangers&mdash;Description of the papyrus&mdash;Vessels of bulrushes.</p></blockquote>


<p>The name of the Heron is only mentioned twice in the Scriptures&mdash;namely,
in the two parallel passages of Lev. xi. 19 and
Deut. xiv. 18; in both of which places the Heron is ranked
among the unclean birds that might not be eaten.</p>

<p>In some of the cases where beasts or birds are prohibited as
food, the prohibition seems scarcely needed. To us of the
present day this seems to be the case with the Heron, as it
is never brought to table. The reason for this disuse of the
Heron as food is not that it is unfit for the table, but that it
has become so scarce by the spread of cultivation and housebuilding,
that it has been gradually abandoned as a practically
unattainable article of diet. The flesh of the Heron, like that
of the bittern, is remarkably excellent, and in the former days,
when it was comparatively plentiful, and falconry was the ordinary
amusement of the rich, the Heron formed a very important
dish at every great banquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="sharon" id="sharon"></a>
<img src="images/i_542.jpg" width="400" height="403" alt="sharon" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HERON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The bird, however, must be eaten when young. A gentleman
who liked to try experiments for himself in the matter of food,
found that, if young Herons were properly cooked, they formed
a most excellent dish, equal, in his opinion, to grouse. Wishing
to have his own judgment confirmed by that of others, he
had several of them trussed and dressed like wild geese, and
served up at table under that name. The guests approved
greatly of the bird, and compared it to hare, the resemblance
being further increased by the dark colour of the flesh. There
was not the slighest fishy flavour about the bird. This, however,
is apt to be found in the older birds, but can be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
by burying them in the earth for several days, just as is done
with the solan goose and one or two other sea-birds.</p>

<p>The abundance of birds belonging to the Heron tribe is well
shown by some of the paintings and carvings on Egyptian
monuments, in which various species of Herons and other
water-birds are depicted as living among the papyrus reeds,
exactly the locality in which they are most plentiful at the
present day.</p>

<p>Unlike the bittern, the Heron is a most sociable bird, and
loves not only to live, but even to feed, in company with others
of its own species.</p>

<p>I have watched the Herons feeding in close proximity to each
other. The birds were fond of wading stealthily along the edge
of the lake until they came to a suitable spot, where they would
stand immersed in the water up to the thighs, waiting patiently
for their prey. They stood as still as if they were carved out
of wood, the ripples of the lake reflected on their plumage as
the breeze ruffled the surface of the water. Suddenly there
would be a quick dive of the beak, either among the reeds or in
the water, and each stroke signified that the Heron had caught
its prey.</p>

<p>Frogs and small fishes are the usual food of the Heron, though
it often grapples with larger prey, having been seen to capture
an eel of considerable size in its beak. Under such circumstances
it leaves the water, with the fish in its mouth, and beats
it violently against a stone so as to kill it. Now and then the bird
is vanquished in the struggle by the fish, several instances
being known in which an eel, in its endeavours to escape, has
twisted itself so tightly round the neck of the bird that both
have been found lying dead on the shore.</p>

<p>In one such case the Heron's beak had struck through the
eyes of the eel, so that the bird could not disengage itself. In
another the Heron had tried to swallow an eel which was
much too large for it, and had been nearly choked by its
meal. The eel must necessarily have been a very large one,
as the Heron has a wonderful capacity for devouring fish. Even
when quite young, it can swallow a fish as large as a herring,
and when it is full grown it will eat four or five large herrings
at a meal.</p>

<p>Now when we remember that a man of average appetite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a><br /><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>finds one herring to form a very sufficient breakfast, we can
easily imagine what must be the digestive power of a bird
which, though very inferior to man in point of bulk, can
eat four times as much at a meal. Even though the fish be
much larger in diameter than the neck of the bird, the Heron
can swallow it as easily as a small snake swallows a large
frog. The neck merely seems to expand as if it were made of
Indiarubber, the fish slips down, and the bird is ready for
another.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="homerun" id="homerun"></a>
<img src="images/i_544.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="homerun" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HOME OF THE HERON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Generally the Herons feed after sunset, but I have frequently
seen them busily engaged in catching their prey in full daylight,
when the sunbeams were playing in the water so as to
produce the beautiful rippling effect on the Heron's plumage
which has already been mentioned.</p>

<p>The Heron does not restrict itself to fishes or reptiles, but,
like the bittern, feeds on almost any kind of aquatic animal
which comes within its reach. When it lives near tidal rivers,
it feeds largely on the shrimps, prawns, green crabs, and
various other crustacea; and when it lives far inland, it still
makes prey of the fresh-water shrimps, the water-beetles, and
the boat-flies, and similar aquatic creatures. In fact, it acts
much after the fashion of the lions, tigers, and leopards,
which put up with locusts and beetles when they can find no
larger prey.</p>

<p>The long beak of the Heron is not merely an instrument by
which it can obtain food, but is also a weapon of considerable
power. When attacked, it aims a blow at the eye of its opponent,
and makes the stroke with such rapidity that the foe is
generally blinded before perceiving the danger. When domesticated,
it has been known to keep possession of the enclosure in
which it lived, and soon to drive away dogs by the power of its
beak. When it is young, it is quite helpless, its very long legs
being unable to support its body, which is entirely bare of
plumage, and has a very unprepossessing appearance.</p>

<p>The flight of the Heron is very powerful, its wings being very
large in proportion to its slender body. Sometimes the bird
takes to ascending in a spiral line, and then the flight is as
beautiful as it is strong. When chased by the falcon it mostly
ascends in this manner, each of the two birds trying to rise
above the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>The nest of the Heron is always made on the top of some
lofty tree, whenever the bird builds in places where trees can be
found; and as the bird is an eminently sociable one, a single
nest is very seldom found, the Heron being as fond of society as
the rook. In some parts of Palestine, however, where trees are
very scarce, the Heron is obliged to choose some other locality for
its nest, and in that case prefers the great thickets of papyrus
reeds which are found in the marshes, and which are even more
inaccessible than the tops of trees.</p>

<p>One of these marshes is well described by Mr. Tristram in his
"Land of Israel." "The whole marsh is marked in the map as
impassable; and most truly it is so. I never anywhere have met
with a swamp so vast and utterly impenetrable.</p>

<p>"The papyrus extends right across to the east side. A false
step off its roots will take the intruder over head in suffocating
peat-mud. We spent a long time in attempting to effect an
entrance, and at last gave it up, satisfied that the marsh birds
were not to be had. In fact, the whole is simply a floating bog of
several miles square; a very thin crust of vegetation covers an
unknown depth of water; and, if the explorer breaks through
this, suffocation is imminent. Some of the Arabs, who were
tilling the plain for cotton, assured us that even a wild boar
never got through it. We shot two bitterns, but in endeavouring
to retrieve them I slipped from the root on which I was standing,
and was drawn down in a moment, only saving myself from
drowning by my gun, which had providentially caught across a
papyrus stem."</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned that the bulrush of Scripture is
undoubtedly the papyrus. The ark or basket of bulrushes, lined
with slime and pitch, in which Moses was laid, was made of
the papyrus, which at the present day is used for the manufacture
of baskets, mats, sandals, and for the thatching of houses.
Many tribes which inhabit the banks of the Nile make simple
boats, or rather rafts, of the papyrus, which they cut and tie in
bundles; and it is worthy of notice that the Australian native
makes a reed boat in almost exactly the same manner.</p>

<p>Compare Is. xviii. 1, 2: "Woe to the land shadowing with
wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>"That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
bulrushes." Did we not know that vessels are actually made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
bulrushes at the present day, a custom which has survived from
very ancient times, we might find a difficulty in understanding
this passage, while the meaning is intelligible enough when it is
viewed by the light of the knowledge that the Ethiopian of the
present day takes gold, and ivory, and other merchandise down
the Nile in his boat of papyrus (or bulrush) reeds tied together.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 275px;"><a name="papyrus" id="papyrus"></a>
<img src="images/i_547.jpg" width="275" height="306" alt="papyrus" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PAPYRUS PLANT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The papyrus runs from ten to fifteen or sixteen feet in height,
so that the Herons are at no loss for suitable spots whereon to
place their nests. From the name "papyrus" our word paper
is derived. The stems of the plant, after having been split into
thin slices, joined together, and brought to a smooth surface,
formed the paper upon which the ancient Egyptians wrote.</p>

<p>The Egrets, which are probably included under the generic
title of Anâphah, are birds of passage, and at the proper season
are plentiful in Palestine. These pretty birds much resemble
the heron in general form, and in general habits both birds are
very much alike, haunting the marshes and edges of lakes and
streams, and feeding upon the frogs and other inhabitants of the
water. In countries where rice is cultivated, the Egret may
generally be seen in the artificial swamps in which that plant is
sown. The colour of the Egret is pure white, with the exception
of the train. This consists of a great number of long slender
feathers of a delicate straw colour. Like those which form the
train of the peacock, they fall over the feathers of the tail, and
entirely conceal them.</p>

<p>In the description of the dove and the swallow two passages
have been quoted in which the name of the <span class="smcap">Crane</span> is mentioned,
one referring to its voice, and the other to its migratory
instinct. The first passage occurs in Isa. xxxviii. 14: "Like a

"The turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of
their coming."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE CRANE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is rather remarkable that in both these cases the word
"Crane" is used in connexion with the swallow, or rather the
swift, and that in both instances the names of the birds should
have been interchanged. If we refer to the original of these
passages, we shall find that the former of them would run
thus, "Like a <em>sis</em> or an <em>agur</em>," and the latter thus, "The turtle
and the <em>sis</em> and the <em>agur</em>." That in these passages the interpretation
of the words <em>sis</em> and <em>agur</em> have been interchanged has
already been mentioned, and, as the former has been described
under the name of swallow or swift, we shall now treat of the
latter under the title of Crane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>The species here mentioned is the common Crane, a bird which
has a very wide range, and which seeks a warm climate on the
approach of winter.</p>

<p>The Crane performs its annual migrations in company, vast
flocks of many thousand individuals passing like great clouds at
an immense height, whence their trumpet-like cry is audible for
a great distance round, and attracts the ear if not the eye to
them. Thus we have at a glance both the characteristics to
which reference is made in the Scriptures, namely, the noisy cry
and the habit of migration.</p>

<p>It is a very gregarious bird, associating with its comrades in
flocks, just as do the starlings and rooks of our own country,
and, like these birds, has favourite roosting-places in which it
passes the night. When evening approaches, the Cranes may
be seen in large flocks passing to their roosting-places, and, on
account of their great size, having a very strange effect. A fair-sized
Crane will measure seven feet across the expanded wings,
so that even a solitary bird has a very imposing effect when
flying, while that of a large flock of Cranes on the wing is
simply magnificent.</p>

<p>The spots which the Crane selects for its roosting-places are
generally of the same character. Being in some respects a wary
bird, though it is curiously indifferent in others, it will not roost
in any place near bushes, rocks, or other spots which might
serve to conceal an enemy. The locality most favoured by the
Crane is a large, smooth, sloping bank, far from any spot wherein
an enemy may be concealed. The birds keep a careful watch
during the night, and it is impossible for any foe to approach
them without being discovered. The Crane is noisy on the wing,
and, whether it be soaring high over head on its long migratory
journeys, or be merely flying at dusk to its roosting-place, it
continually utters its loud, clangorous cry.</p>

<p>The food of the Crane is much like that of the heron, but in
addition to the frogs, fish, worms, and insects, it eats vegetable
substances. Sometimes it is apt to get into cultivated grounds,
and then does much damage to the crops, pecking up the
ground with its long beak, partly for the sake of the worms,
grubs, and other creatures, and partly for the sake of the
sprouting seeds.</p>

<p>Although by reason of its scarcity the Crane has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
abandoned as food, its flesh is really excellent, and in former days
was valued very highly.</p>

<p>Like the egret, the Crane is remarkable for the flowing
plumes of the back, which fall over the tail feathers, and form
a train. These feathers are much used as plumes, both for
purposes of dress and as brushes or flappers wherewith to drive
off the flies. By reason of this conformation, some systematic
zoologists have thought that it has some affinity to the ostrich,
the rh&oelig;a, and similar birds, and that the resemblance is
strengthened by the structure of the digestive organs, which
are suited to vegetable as well as animal substances, the
stomach being strong and muscular.</p>

<p>The peculiar voice of the Crane, which it is so fond of
using, and to which reference is made in the Scriptures, is
caused by a peculiar structure of the windpipe, which is exceedingly
long, and, instead of going straight to the lungs, undergoes
several convolutions about the breast-bone, and then
proceeds to the lungs.</p>

<p>The Crane makes its nest on low ground, generally among
osiers or reeds, and it lays only two eggs, pale olive in colour,
dashed profusely with black and brown streaks.</p>

<h2>THE STORK.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Signification of the Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Chasidah</i>&mdash;Various passages in which it is mentioned&mdash;The
Chasidah therefore a large, wide-winged, migratory bird&mdash;Its identification
with the Stork&mdash;The Stork always protected.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the Old Testament there are several passages wherein is
mentioned the word <em>Chasidah</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p>The Authorized Version invariably renders the word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Chasidah</i>
as "Stork" and is undoubtedly right.</p>

<p>In Buxtorf's Lexicon there is a curious derivation of the word.
He says that the word <i lang="he" xml:lang="i">Chasidah</i> is derived from <em>chesed</em>, a word
that signifies benevolence.</p>

<p>According to some writers, the name was given to the Stork
because it was supposed to be a bird remarkable for its filial
piety; "for the storks in their turn support their parents in
their old age: they allow them to rest their necks on their bodies
during migration, and, if the elders are tired, the young ones
take them on their backs." According to others, the name is
given to the Stork because it exercises kindness towards its
companions in bringing them food; but in all cases the derivation
of the word is acknowledged to be the same.</p>

<p>Partly in consequence of this idea, which is a very old and
almost universal one, and partly on account of the great services
rendered by the bird in clearing the ground of snakes, insects,
and garbage, the Stork has always been protected through the
East, as it is to the present day in several parts of Europe. The
slaughter of a Stork, or even the destruction of its eggs, would
be punished with a heavy fine; and in consequence of the
immunity which it enjoys, it loves to haunt the habitations
of mankind.</p>

<p>In many of the Continental towns, where sanitary regulations
are not enforced, the Stork serves the purpose of a scavenger,
and may be seen walking about the market-place, waiting for
the offal of fish, fowls, and the like, which are simply thrown on
the ground for the Storks to eat. In Eastern lands the Stork
enjoys similar privileges, and we may infer that the bird was
perfectly familiar both to the writers of the various Scriptural
books in which it was mentioned, and to the people for whom
these books were intended.</p>

<p>When they settle upon a tract of ground, the Storks divide it
among themselves in a manner that seems to have a sort of
system in it, spreading themselves over it with wonderful regularity,
each bird appearing to take possession of a definite amount
of ground. By this mode of proceeding, the ground is rapidly
cleared of all vermin; the Storks examining their allotted space
with the keenest scrutiny, and devouring every reptile, mouse,
worm, grub, or insect that they can find on it. Sometimes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a><br /><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
will spread themselves in this manner over a vast extent of
country, arriving suddenly, remaining for several months, and
departing without giving any sign of their intention to move.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;"><a name="storker" id="storker"></a>
<img src="images/i_554.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="storker" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">STORKS AND THEIR NESTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wings of the Stork, which are mentioned in Holy Writ,
are very conspicuous, and are well calculated to strike an imaginative
mind. The general colour of the bird is white, while the
quill feathers of the wings are black; so that the effect of the
spread wings is very striking, an adult bird measuring about
seven feet across, when flying. As the body, large though it
may be, is comparatively light when compared with the extent
of wing, the flight is both lofty and sustained, the bird flying at
very great height, and, when migrating, is literally the "stork in
the heavens."</p>

<p>Next we come to the migratory habits of the Stork.</p>

<p>Like the swallow, the Stork resorts year after year to the same
spots; and when it has once fixed on a locality for its nest, that
place will be assuredly taken as regularly as the breeding-season
comes round. The same pair are sure to return to their well-known
home, notwithstanding the vast distances over which
they pass, and the many lands in which they sojourn. Should
one of the pair die, the other finds a mate in a very short time,
and thus the same home is kept up by successive generations of
Storks, much as among men one ancestral mansion is inhabited
by a series of members of the same family.</p>

<p>So well is this known, that when a pair of Storks have made
their nest in a human habitation their return is always expected,
and when they arrive the absentees are welcomed on all
sides. In many countries breeding-places are specially provided
for the Storks; and when one of them is occupied for the first
time, the owner of the house looks upon it as a fortunate omen.</p>

<p>The localities chosen by the Stork for its nest vary according
to the surrounding conditions. The foundation which a Stork
requires is a firm platform, the more elevated the better, but the
bird seems to care little whether this platform be on rocks,
buildings, or trees. If, for example, it builds its nest in craggy
places, far from the habitations of man, it selects some flat ledge
for the purpose, preferring those that are at the extreme tops of
the rocks. The summit of a natural pinnacle is a favourite spot
with the Stork.</p>

<p>In many cases the Stork breeds among old ruins, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
such circumstances it is fond of building its nest on the tops of
pillars or towers, the summits of arches, and similar localities.
When it takes up its abode among mankind, it generally selects
the breeding-places which have been built for it by those who
know its taste, but it frequently chooses the top of a chimney,
or some such locality.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, it is obliged to build in spots where it
can find neither rocks nor buildings, and in such cases it builds
on trees, and, like the heron, is sociable in its nesting, a whole
community residing in a clump of trees. It is not very particular
about the kind of tree, provided that it be tolerably tall,
and strong enough to bear the weight of its enormous nest; and
the reader will at once see that the fir-trees are peculiarly fitted
to be the houses for the Stork.</p>

<p>As may be expected from the localities chosen by the Stork
for its breeding-place, its nest is very large and heavy. It is
constructed with very little skill, and is scarcely more than a
huge quantity of sticks, reeds, and similar substances, heaped
together, and having in the middle a slight depression in which
the eggs are laid. These eggs are usually three, or perhaps four
in number, and now and then a fifth is seen, and are of a very
pale buff or cream colour.</p>

<p>As is the case with the heron, the young of the Stork are
quite helpless when hatched, and are most ungainly little beings,
with their long legs doubled under them, unable to sustain their
round and almost naked bodies, while their large beaks are ever
gaping for food. Those of my readers who have had young
birds of any kind must have noticed the extremely grotesque
appearance which they possess when they hold up their heads
and cry for food, with their bills open to an almost incredible
extent. In such birds as the Stork, the heron, and others of the
tribe, the grotesque appearance is exaggerated in proportion to
the length and gape of the bill.</p>

<p>The Stork is noted for being a peculiarly kind and loving
parent to its young, in that point fully deserving the derivation
of its Hebrew name, though its love manifests itself towards
the young, and not towards the parent.</p>

<p>The Rev. H. B. Tristram mentions from personal experience an
instance of the watchful care exercised by the Stork over its
young. "The writer was once in camp near an old ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
tower in the plains of Zana, south of the Atlas, where a pair of
storks had their nest. The four young might often be seen from
a little distance, surveying the prospect from their lonely height,
but whenever any of the human party happened to stroll near
the tower, one of the old storks, invisible before, would instantly
appear, and, lighting on the nest, put its feet gently on the necks
of all the young, so as to hold them down out of sight till the
stranger had passed, snapping its bill meanwhile, and assuming a
grotesque air of indifference, as if unconscious of there being anything
under its charge."</p>

<p>The snapping noise which is here mentioned is the only sound
produced by the Stork, which is an absolutely silent bird, as far
as voice is concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is another species of Stork found in Palestine, to which
the fir-trees are especially a home. This is the Black Stork
(<em>Ciconia nigra</em>), which in some parts of the country is even more
plentiful than its white relative, which it resembles in almost
every particular, except that it has a dark head and back, the
feathers being glossed with purple and green like those of the
magpie. This species, which is undoubtedly included in the
Hebrew word <em>chasidah</em>, always makes its nest on trees whenever
it can find them, and in some of the more densely wooded parts
of Palestine is in consequence plentiful, placing its nest in the
deepest parts of the forests. When it cannot obtain trees, it will
build its nest on rocky ledges. It lays two or three eggs of a
greenish white colour.</p>

<p>Like the preceding species, the Black Stork is easily domesticated.
Colonel Montague kept one which was very tame, and
would follow its keeper like a dog. Its tameness enabled its
proceedings to be closely watched, and its mode of feeding was
thereby investigated. It was fond of examining the rank grass
and mud for food, and while doing so always kept its bill a little
open, so as to pounce down at once on any insect or reptile that
it might disturb.</p>

<p>Eels were its favourite food, and it was such an adept at
catching them that it was never seen to miss one, no matter how
small or quick it might be. As soon as it had caught one of
these active fish, it went to some dry place, and then disabled
its prey by shaking and beating it against the ground before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
swallowing it, whereas many birds that feed on fish swallow
their prey as soon as it is caught. The Stork was never seen to
swim as the heron sometimes does, but it would wade as long as
it could place its feet on the bed of the stream, and would strain
its head and the whole of its neck under water in searching
for fish.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A NEST OF THE WHITE STORK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was of a mild and peaceable disposition, and, even if
angered, did not attempt to bite or strike with its beak, but
only denoted its displeasure by blowing the air sharply from its
lungs, and nodding its head repeatedly. After the manner of
Storks, it always chose an elevated spot on which to repose,
and took its rest standing on one leg, with its head so sunk
among the feathers of its shoulders that scarcely any part of it
was visible, the hinder part of the head resting on the back, and
the bill lying on the fore-part of the neck.</p>

<p>Though the bird is so capable of domestication, it does not of
its own accord haunt the dwellings of men, like the White
Stork, but avoids the neighbourhood of houses, and lives in the
most retired places it can find.</p>

<h2>THE SWAN.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Signification of the word <em>Tinshemeth</em>&mdash;The Gallinule and the Ibis&mdash;Appearance
and habits of the Hyacinthine Gallinule&mdash;A strange use for the bird&mdash;The
White or Sacred Ibis.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the two parallel chapters of Lev. xi. 18 and Deut. xiv. 16,
the Hebrew word <em>tinshemeth</em> is found, and evidently signifies
some kind of bird which was forbidden as food. After stating
(Lev. xi. 13) that "these are they which ye shall have in abomination
among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an
abomination," the sacred lawgiver proceeds to enumerate a
number of birds, nearly all of which have already been described.
Among them occurs the name of <em>tinshemeth</em>, between
the great owl and the pelican.</p>

<p>What was the precise species of bird which was signified by
this name it is impossible to say, but there is no doubt that it
could not have been the Swan, according to the rendering of the
Authorized Version. The Swan is far too rare a bird in Palestine
to have been specially mentioned in the law of Moses, and
in all probability it was totally unknown to the generality of the
Israelites. Even had it been known to them, and tolerably
common, there seems to be no reason why it should have been
reckoned among the list of unclean birds.</p>

<p>On turning to the Hebrew Bible, we find that the word is left
untranslated, and simply given in its Hebrew form, thereby
signifying that the translators could form no opinion whatever of
the proper rendering of the word. The Septuagint translates the
Tinshemeth as the Porphyrio or Ibis, and the Vulgate follows the
same rendering. Later naturalists have agreed that the Septuagint
and Vulgate have the far more probable reading; and, as
two birds are there mentioned, they will be both described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="ibis" id="ibis"></a>
<img src="images/i_560.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="ibis" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IBIS AND GALLINULE (SWAN OF SCRIPTURE).</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first is the Porphyrio, by which we may understand the
<span class="smcap">Hyacinthine Gallinule</span> (<em>Porphyrio veterum</em>). All the birds of
this group are remarkable for the enormous length of their toes,
by means of which they are enabled to walk upon the loose
herbage that floats on the surface of the water as firmly as if
they were treading on land. Their feet are also used, like those
of the parrots, in conveying food to the mouth. We have in
England a very familiar example of the Gallinules in the common
water-hen, or moor-hen, the toes of which are of great proportionate
length, though not so long as those of the Purple Gallinule,
which almost rivals in this respect the jacanas of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
America and China. The water-rail, and corncrake or land-rail,
are also allied to the Gallinules.</p>

<p>The Hyacinthine Gallinule derives its name from its colour,
which is a rich and variable blue, taking a turquoise hue on the
head, neck, throat, and breast, and deep indigo on the back.
The large bill and the legs are red. Like many other birds,
however, it varies much in colour according to age.</p>

<p>It has a very wide geographical range, being found in many
parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is common in the marshy
districts of Palestine, where its rich blue plumage and its large
size, equalling that of a duck, render it very conspicuous. The
large and powerful bill of this bird betokens the nature of its
food, which consists almost entirely of hard vegetable substances,
the seeds of aquatic herbage forming a large portion of
its diet. When it searches for food on the seashore, it eats the
marine vegetation, mixing with this diet other articles of an
animal nature, such as molluscs and small reptiles.</p>

<p>Though apparently a clumsy bird, it moves with wonderful
speed, running not only swiftly but gracefully, its large feet
being no hindrance to the rapidity of its movements. It is
mostly found in shallow marshes, where the construction of its
feet enables it to traverse both the soft muddy ground and the
patches of firm earth with equal ease. Its wings, however, are
by no means equal to its legs either in power or activity; and,
like most of the rail tribe, it never takes to the air unless absolutely
obliged to do so.</p>

<p>The nest of the Hyacinthine Gallinule is made on the sedge-patches
which dot the marshes, much like that of the coot. The
nest, too, resembles that of the coot, being composed of reeds,
sedges, and other aquatic plants. The eggs are three or four in
number, white in colour, and nearly spherical in form.</p>

<p>As the Ibis has an equal claim to the title of Tinshemeth
we will devote a few lines to a description of the bird.
The particular species which would be signified by the word
<em>tinshemeth</em> would undoubtedly be the <span class="smcap">White</span> or <span class="smcap">Sacred Ibis</span>
(<em>Ibis religiosa</em>), a bird which derives its name of Sacred from
the reverence with which it was held by the ancient Egyptians,
and the frequency with which its figure occurs in the monumental
sculptures. It was also thought worthy of being embalmed,
and many mummies of the Ibis have been found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
old Egyptian burial-places, having been preserved for some three
thousand years.</p>

<p>It is about as large as an ordinary hen, and, as its name imports,
has the greater part of its plumage white, the ends of
the wing-feathers and the coverts being black, with violet reflections.
The long neck is black and bare, and has a most curious
aspect, looking as if it were made of an old black kid glove,
very much crumpled, but still retaining its gloss.</p>

<p>The reason for the extreme veneration with which the bird
was regarded by the ancient Egyptians seems rather obscure.
It is probable, however, that the partial migration of the bird
was connected in their minds with the rise of the Nile, a river
as sacred to the old Egyptians as the Ganges to the modern
Hindoo. As soon as the water begins to rise, the Ibis makes its
appearance, sometimes alone, and sometimes in small troops. It
haunts the banks of the river, and marshy places in general,
diligently searching for food by the aid of its long bill. It can
fly well and strongly, and it utters at intervals a rather loud cry,
dipping its head at every utterance.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE CORMORANT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The word <em>Shâlâk</em> and its signification&mdash;Habits of the Cormorant&mdash;The bird trained
to catch fish&mdash;Mode of securing its prey&mdash;Nests and eggs of the Cormorant&mdash;Nesting
in fir-trees&mdash;Flesh of the bird.</p></blockquote>


<p>Although in the Authorized Version of the Scriptures the word
Cormorant occurs three times, there is no doubt that in two of
the passages the Hebrew word ought to have been rendered as
Pelican, as we shall see when we come presently to the description
of that bird.</p>

<p>In the two parallel passages, Lev. xi. 17 and Deut. xiv. 17,
a creature called the Shâlâk is mentioned in the list of prohibited
meats. That the Shâlâk must be a bird is evident from the
context, and we are therefore only left to discover what sort of
bird it may be. On looking at the etymology of the word we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
find that it is derived from a root which signifies hurling or
casting down, and we may therefore presume that the bird is one
which plunges or sweeps down upon its prey.</p>

<p>Weighing, carefully, the opinions of the various Hebraists and
naturalists, we may safely determine that the word <em>shâlâk</em> has
been rightly translated in the Authorized Version. The Hebrew
Bible gives the same reading, and does not affix the mark of
doubt to the word, though there are very few of the long list of
animals in Lev. xi. and Deut. xiv. which are not either distinguished
by the mark of doubt, or, like the Tinshemeth, are left
untranslated.</p>

<p>The Cormorant belongs to the family of the pelicans, the relationship
between them being evident to the most unpractised
eye; and the whole structure of the bird shows its admirable
adaptation for the life which it leads.</p>

<p>Its long beak enables it to seize even a large fish, while the
hook at the end prevents the slippery prey from escaping. The
long snake-like neck gives the bird the power of darting its
beak with great rapidity, and at the same time allows it to seize
prey immediately to the right or left of its course. Its strong,
closely-feathered wings enable it to fly with tolerable speed, while
at the same time they can be closed so tightly to the body that
they do not hinder the progress of the bird through the water;
while the tail serves equally when spread to direct its course
through the air, and when partially or entirely closed to act as a
rudder in the water. Lastly, its short powerful legs, with their
broadly-webbed feet, act as paddles, by which the bird urges
itself through the water with such wonderful speed that it can
overtake and secure the fishes even in their own element. Besides
these outward characteristics, we find that the bird is able
to make a very long stay under water, the lungs being adapted so
as to contain a wonderful amount of air.</p>

<p>The Cormorant has been trained to play the same part in
the water as the falcon in the air, and has been taught to
catch fish, and bring them ashore for its master. So adroit
are they, that if one of them should catch a fish which is too
heavy for it, another bird will come to its assistance, and the
two together will bring the struggling prey to land. Trained
birds of this description have been employed in China from time
immemorial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to prevent it from swallowing the fish which it takes,
each bird has a ring or ligature passed round its neck.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Cormorant is a most voracious bird, swallowing a considerable
weight of fish at a meal, and digesting them so rapidly
that it is soon ready for another supply. Although it is essentially
a marine bird, hunger often takes it inland, especially to
places where there are lakes or large rivers.</p>

<p>While the ducks and teal and widgeons may be stationary on the
pool, the cormorant is seen swimming to and fro, as if in quest
of something. First raising his body nearly perpendicular, down
he plunges into the deep, and, after staying there a considerable
time, he is sure to bring up a fish, which he invariably swallows
head foremost. Sometimes half an hour elapses before he can
manage to accommodate a large eel quietly in his stomach.</p>

<p>You see him straining violently with repeated efforts to gulp
it; and when you fancy that the slippery mouthful is successfully
disposed of, all on a sudden the eel retrogrades upwards
from its dismal sepulchre, struggling violently to escape. The
cormorant swallows it again, and up again it comes, and shows
its tail a foot or more out of its destroyer's mouth. At length,
worn out with ineffectual writhings and slidings, the eel is
gulped down into the cormorant's stomach for the last time,
there to meet its dreaded and inevitable fate.</p>

<p>Mr. Fortune gives a very interesting account of the feeding
of tame Cormorants in China. The birds preferred eels to all
other food, and, in spite of the difficulty in swallowing the
slippery and active creature, would not touch another fish as
long as an eel was left. The bird is so completely at home in the
water that it does not need, like the heron and other aquatic birds,
to bring its prey ashore in order to swallow it, but can eat fish
in the water as well as catch them. It always seizes the fish
crosswise, and is therefore obliged to turn it before it can swallow
the prey with the head downwards. Sometimes it contrives to
turn the fish while still under water, but, if it should fail in so
doing, it brings its prey to the surface, and shifts it about in its
bill, making a series of little snatches at it until the head is in
the right direction. When it seizes a very large fish, the bird
shakes its prey just as a dog shakes a rat, and so disables it. It
is said to eat its own weight of fish in a single day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, when it has been very successful or exceptionally
hungry, it loads itself with food to such an extent that it becomes
almost insensible during the process of digestion, and,
although naturally a keen-eyed and wary bird, allows itself to
be captured by hand.</p>

<p>The nest of the Cormorant is always upon a rocky ledge, and
generally on a spot which is inaccessible except by practised
climbers furnished with ropes, poles, hooks, and other appurtenances.
Mr. Waterton mentions that when he descended the
Raincliff, a precipice some four hundred feet in height, he saw
numbers of the nests and eggs, but could not get at them except
by swinging himself boldly off the face of the cliff, so as to be
brought by the return swing into the recesses chosen by the
birds.</p>

<p>The nests are mostly placed in close proximity to each other,
and are made of sticks and seaweeds, and, as is usual with such
nests, are very inartificially constructed. The eggs are of a
greenish white on the outside, and green on the inside. When
found in the nest, they are covered with a sort of chalky crust,
so that the true colour is not perceptible until the crust is
scraped off. Two to four eggs are generally laid in, or rather on,
each nest. As may be imagined from the character of the birds'
food, the odour of the nesting-place is most horrible.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when rocks cannot be found, the Cormorant is
obliged to select other spots for its nest. It is mentioned in the
"Proceedings of the Zoological Society," that upon an island in
the midst of a large lake there were a number of Scotch fir-trees,
upon the branches of which were about eighty nests of
the Cormorant.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Cormorant is very seldom eaten, as it has a
fishy flavour which is far from agreeable. To eat an old Cormorant
is indeed almost impossible, but the young birds may be
rendered edible by taking them as soon as killed, skinning them,
removing the whole of the interior, wrapping them in cloths,
and burying them for some time in the ground.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that in two passages of Scripture, the
word which is translated in the Authorized Version as Cormorant,
ought to have been rendered as <span class="smcap">Pelican</span>. These, however,
are not the first passages in which we meet with the word
<em>kaath</em>. The name occurs in the two parallel passages of Lev.
xi. and Deut. xiv. among the list of birds which are proscribed
as food. Passing over them, we next come to Ps. cii. 6. In
this passage, the sacred writer is lamenting his misery: "By
reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
skin.</p>

<p>"I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of
the desert."</p>

<p>In these sentences, we see that the Kaath was a bird of
solitude that was to be found in the "wilderness," <em>i.e.</em> far from
the habitations of man. This is one of the characteristics of the
Pelican, which loves not the neighbourhood of human beings,
and is fond of resorting to broad, uncultivated lands, where it
will not be disturbed.</p>

<p>In them it makes its nest and hatches its young, and to them
it retires after feeding, in order to digest in quiet the ample meal
which it has made. Mr. Tristram well suggests that the metaphor
of the Psalmist may allude to the habit common to the Pelican
and its kin, of sitting motionless for hours after it has gorged
itself with food, its head sunk on its shoulders, and its bill
resting on its breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>This is but one of the singular, and often grotesque, attitudes
in which the Pelican is in the habit of indulging.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PELICAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are before me a number of sketches made of the
Pelicans at the Zoological Gardens, and in no two cases does
one attitude in the least resemble another. In one sketch the
bird is sitting in the attitude which has just been described. In
another it is walking, or rather staggering, along, with its head
on one side, and its beak so closed that hardly a vestige of its
enormous pouch can be seen. Another sketch shows the same
bird as it appeared when angry with a companion, and scolding
its foe in impotent rage; while another shows it basking in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
sun, with its magnificent wings spread and shaking in the warm
beams, and its pouch hanging in folds from its chin.</p>

<p>One of the most curious of these sketches shows the bird
squatting on the ground, with its head drawn back as far as
possible, and sunk so far among the feathers of the back and
shoulders that only a portion of the head itself can be seen,
while the long beak is hidden, except an inch or two of the end.
In this attitude it might easily be mistaken at a little distance
for an oval white stone.</p>

<p>The derivation of the Hebrew word <em>kaath</em> is a very curious
one. It is taken from a verb signifying "to vomit," and this
derivation has been explained in different ways.</p>

<p>The early writers, who were comparatively ignorant of natural
history, thought that the Pelican lived chiefly on molluscs, and
that, after digesting the animals, it rejected their shells, just as
the owl and the hawk reject the bones, fur, and feathers of their
prey.</p>

<p>They thought that the Pelican was a bird of a hot temperament,
and that the molluscs were quickly digested by the heat of the
stomach.</p>

<p>At the present day, however, knowing as we do the habits of
the Pelican, we find that, although the reasons just given are
faulty, and that the Pelican lives essentially on fish, and not on
molluscs, the derivation of the word is really a good one, and
that those who gave the bird the name of Kaath, or the vomiter,
were well acquainted with its habits.</p>

<p>The bird certainly does eat molluscs, but the principal part
of its diet is composed of fish, which it catches dexterously by
a sort of sidelong snatch of its enormous bill. The skin under
the lower part of the beak is so modified that it can form, when
distended, an enormous pouch, capable of holding a great quantity
of fish, though, as long as it is not wanted, the pouch is so
contracted into longitudinal folds as to be scarcely perceptible.
When it has filled the pouch, it usually retires from the water,
and flies to a retired spot, often many miles inland, where it
can sit and digest at its ease the enormous meal which it has
made.</p>

<p>As it often chooses its breeding-places in similar spots, far
from the water, it has to carry the food with which it nourishes
its young for many miles. For this purpose it is furnished, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
only with the pouch which has been just mentioned, but with
long, wide, and very powerful wings, often measuring from twelve
to thirteen feet from tip to tip. No one, on looking at a Pelican
as it waddles about or sits at rest, would imagine the gigantic
dimensions of the wings, which seem, as the bird spreads them,
to have almost as unlimited a power of expansion as the pouch.</p>

<p>In these two points the true Pelicans present a strong contrast
to the cormorants, though birds closely allied. The cormorant
has its home close by the sea, and therefore needs not to carry
its food for any distance. Consequently, it needs no pouch,
and has none. Neither does it require the great expanse of
wing which is needful for the Pelican, that has to carry such
a weight of fish through the air. Accordingly, the wings, though
strong enough to enable the bird to carry for a short distance
a single fish of somewhat large size, are comparatively short and
closely feathered, and the flight of the cormorant possesses
neither the grace nor the power which distinguishes that of the
Pelican.</p>

<p>When the Pelican feeds its young, it does so by pressing its
beak against its breast, so as to force out of it the enclosed fish.
Now the tip of the beak is armed, like that of the cormorant,
with a sharply-curved hook, only, in the case of the Pelican, the
hook is of a bright scarlet colour, looking, when the bird presses
the beak against the white feathers of the breast, like a large
drop of blood. Hence arose the curious legend respecting the
Pelican, which represented it as feeding its young with its own
blood, and tearing open its breast with its hooked bill. We find
that this legend is exemplified by the oft-recurring symbol of the
"Pelican feeding its young" in ecclesiastical art, as an emblem
of Divine love.</p>

<p>This is one of the many instances in which the inventive,
poetical, inaccurate Oriental mind has seized some peculiarity of
form, and based upon it a whole series of fabulous legends. As
long as they restricted themselves to the appearance and habits
of the animals with which they were familiarly acquainted, the
old writers were curiously full, exact, and precise in their details.
But as soon as they came to any creature of whose mode of life
they were entirely or partially ignorant, they allowed their
inventive faculties full scope, and put forward as zoological facts
statements which were the mere creation of their own fancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
We have already seen several examples of this propensity, and
shall find more as we proceed with the zoology of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>The fabulous legends of the Pelican are too numerous to be
even mentioned, but there is one which deserves notice, because
it is made the basis of an old Persian fable.</p>

<p>The writer of the legend evidently had some partial knowledge
of the bird. He knew that it had a large pouch which could
hold fish and water; that it had large and powerful wings; and
that it was in the habit of flying far inland, either for the purpose
of digesting its food or nourishing its young. Knowing that the
Pelican is in the habit of choosing solitary spots in which it may
bring up its young in safety, but not knowing the precise mode
of its nesting, the writer in question has trusted to his imagination,
and put forward his theories as facts.</p>

<p>Knowing that the bird dwells in "the wilderness," he has
assumed that the wilderness in question is a sandy, arid desert,
far from water, and consequently from vegetation. Such being
the case, the nurture of the Pelican's young is evidently a difficult
question. Being aquatic birds, the young must needs require
water for drink and bathing, as well as fish for food; and, though
a supply of both these necessaries could be brought in the ample
pouches of the parents, they would be wasted unless some mode
of storing were employed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the parent birds were said to make their nest
in a hollow tree, and to line it with clay, or to build it altogether
of clay, so as to leave a deep basin. This basin the parent birds
were said to use as a sort of store-pond, bringing home supplies
of fish and water in their pouches, and pouring them into the
pond. The wild beasts who lived in the desert were said to be
acquainted with these nests, and to resort to them daily in order
to quench their thirst, repaying their entertainers by protecting
their homes.</p>

<p>In real fact, the Pelican mostly breeds near water, and is fond
of selecting little rocky islands where it cannot be approached
without danger. The nest is made on the ground, and is formed
in a most inartificial manner of reeds and grass, the general mass
of the nest being made of the reeds, and the lining being formed
of grass. The eggs are white, of nearly the same shape at both
ends, and are from two to five in number. On an average,
however, each nest will contain about two eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>The parent birds are very energetic in defence of their eggs or
young, and, according to Le Vaillant, when approached they are
"like furious harpies let loose against us, and their cries rendered
us almost deaf. They often flew so near us that they
flapped their wings in our faces, and, though we fired our pieces
repeatedly, we were not able to frighten them." When the well-known
naturalist Sonnerat tried to drive a female Pelican
from her nest, she appeared not to be frightened, but angry.
She would not move from her nest, and when he tried to
push her off, she struck at him with her long bill and uttered
cries of rage.</p>

<p>In order to aid the bird in carrying the heavy weights with
which it loads itself, the whole skeleton is permeated with air,
and is exceedingly light. Beside this, the whole cellular system
of the bird is honeycombed with air-cells, so that the bulk of
the bird can be greatly increased, while its weight remains
practically unaltered, and the Pelican becomes a sort of living
balloon.</p>

<p>The habit of conveying its food inland before eating it is so
characteristic of the Pelican that other birds take advantage of
it. In some countries there is a large hawk which robs the
Pelican, just as the bald-headed eagle of America robs the
osprey. Knowing instinctively that when a Pelican is flying
inland slowly and heavily and with a distended pouch it is
carrying a supply of food to its home, the hawk dashes at it,
and frightens it so that the poor bird opens its beak, and gives
up to the assailant the fish which it was bearing homewards.</p>

<p>It is evident that the wings which are needed for supporting
such weights, and which, as we have seen, exceed twelve feet in
length from tip to tip, would be useless in the water, and would
hinder rather than aid the bird if it attempted to dive as the
close-winged cormorant does. Accordingly, we find that the
Pelican is not a diver, and, instead of chasing its finny prey
under water, after the manner of the cormorant, it contents
itself with scooping up in its beak the fishes which come to the
surface of the water. The very buoyancy of its body would
prevent it from diving as does the cormorant, and, although it
often plunges into the water so fairly as to be for a moment
submerged, it almost immediately rises, and pursues its course
on the surface of the water, and not beneath it. Like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
cormorant, the Pelican can perch on trees, though it does not
select such spots for its roosting-places, and prefers rocks to
branches. In one case, however, when some young Pelicans
had been captured and tied to a stake, their mother used to
bring them food during the day, and at night was accustomed
to roost in the branches of a tree above them.</p>

<p>Though under some circumstances a thoroughly social bird, it
is yet fond of retiring to the most solitary spots in order to consume
at peace the prey that it has captured; and, as it sits motionless
and alone for hours, more like a white stone than a bird, it
may well be accepted as a type of solitude and desolation.</p>

<p>The colour of the common Pelican is white, with a very slight
pinky tinge, which is most conspicuous in the breeding season.
The feathers of the crest are yellow, and the quill feathers of
the wings are jetty black, contrasting well with the white
plumage of the body. The pouch is yellow, and the upper
part of the beak bluish grey, with a red line running across
the middle, and a bright red hook at the tip. This plumage
belongs only to the adult bird, that of the young being ashen
grey, and four or five years are required before the bird puts on
its full beauty. There is no difference in the appearance of the
sexes. The illustration represents a fine old male Crested Pelican.
The general colour is a greyish white, with a slight yellowish tint
on the breast. The pouch is bright orange, and the crest is formed
of curling feathers.</p>

<h2>THE TORTOISE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Tzab of the Scriptures, translated as Tortoise&mdash;Flesh and eggs of the Tortoise&mdash;Its
slow movements&mdash;Hibernation dependent on temperature&mdash;The Water-Tortoises&mdash;Their
food and voracity&mdash;Their eggs&mdash;Their odour terrifying the
horses&mdash;The Dhubb lizard and its legends&mdash;Its food, and localities which it
prefers.</p></blockquote>


<p>We now come to a different class of animated beings. In Levit.
xi. 29, there occurs among the list of unclean beasts a word which
is translated in the Authorized Version as "tortoise." The word
is <em>Tzab</em>, and is rendered in the Hebrew Bible as "lizard," but
with the mark of doubt affixed to it. As the correct translation
of the word is very dubious, we shall examine it in both these
senses.</p>

<p>The common Tortoise is very common in Palestine, and is so
plentiful that it would certainly have been used by the Israelites
as food, had it not been prohibited by law. At the present day
it is cooked and eaten by the inhabitants of the country who
are not Jews, and its eggs are in as great request as those of the
fowl.</p>

<p>These eggs are hard, nearly spherical, thick-shelled, and
covered with minute punctures, giving them a roughness like
that of a file. In captivity the Tortoise is very careless about
the mode in which they are deposited, and I have seen a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
yard almost covered with eggs laid by Tortoises and abandoned.
The white or albumen of the egg is so stiff and gelatinous that
to empty one of them without breaking the shell is a difficult
task, and the yolk is very dark, and covered with minute spots
of black. When fresh the eggs are as good as those of the fowl,
and many persons even think them better; the only drawback
being that their small size and thick shell cause considerable
trouble in eating them.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="dhubb" id="dhubb"></a>
<img src="images/i_577.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="dhubb" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE DHUBB OR LIZARD AND THE TORTOISE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The flesh of the Tortoise is eaten, not only by human beings,
but by birds, such as the lämmergeier. In order to get at the
flesh of the Tortoise, they carry it high in the air and drop it on
the ground so as to break the shell to pieces, should the reptile
fall on a stone or rock. If, as is not often the case in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
rocky land as that of Palestine, it should fall on a soft spot, the
bird picks it up, soars aloft, and drops it again.</p>

<p>The Tortoises have no teeth, but yet are able to crop the
herbage with perfect ease. In lieu of teeth the edges of the
jaws are sharp-edged and very hard, so that they cut anything
that comes between them like a pair of shears. Leaves that are
pulpy and crisp are bitten through at once, but those that are
thin, tough, and fibrous are rather torn than bitten, the Tortoise
placing its feet upon them, and dragging them to pieces with its
jaws. The carnivorous Tortoises have a similar habit, as we shall
presently see.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WATER TORTOISE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This is the species from whose deliberate and slow movements
the familiar metaphor of "slow as a Tortoise" was derived, and
it is this species which is the hero of the popular fable of the
"Hare and the Tortoise." Many of the reptiles are very slow
in some things and astonishingly quick in others. Some of the
lizards, for example, will at one time remain motionless for
many hours together, or creep about with a slow and snail-like
progress, while at others they dart from spot to spot with such
rapidity that the eye can scarcely follow their movements. This
however is not the case with the Tortoise, which is always slow,
and, but for the defensive armour in which it is encased, would
long ago have been extirpated.</p>

<p>During the whole of the summer months it may be seen
crawling deliberately among the herbage, eating in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
deliberate style which characterises all its movements, and occasionally
resting in the same spot for many hours together,
apparently enjoying the warm beams of the sunshine.</p>

<p>As winter approaches, it slowly scrapes a deep hole in the
ground, and buries itself until the following spring awakes it
once more to active life. The depth of its burrow depends on
the severity of the winter, for, as the cold increases, the Tortoise
sinks itself more deeply into the earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mention has been made of a species of Tortoise that inhabits
the water. This is the <span class="smcap">Caspian Emys</span> (<em>Emys caspica</em>), a small
species, measuring about six inches in length. It belongs to the
large family of the Terrapins, several of which are so well known
in America, and has a long, retractile neck, very sharp jaws, and
webbed feet, and a well-developed tail.</p>

<p>The body is flattish, and the colour is olive, with lines of
yellow edged with black, and the head is marked with longitudinal
streaks of bright yellow. After the death of the creature
these yellow streaks fade away gradually, and at last become
nearly black. The skin of the head is thin, but very hard. In
general appearance it is not unlike the chicken Tortoise of
America, a species which is often brought to England and kept
in captivity, on account of its hardy nature and the little trouble
which is needed for keeping it in health.</p>

<p>I have kept specimens of the Caspian Emys for some time,
and found them to be more interesting animals than they at first
promised to be. They were active, swimming with considerable
speed, and snatching quickly at anything which they fancied
might be food.</p>

<p>They were exceedingly voracious, consuming daily a quantity
of meat apparently disproportioned to their size, and eating it in
a manner that strongly reminded me of the mole when engaged
on a piece of meat or the body of a bird or mouse. The Tortoise
would plant its fore-paws firmly at each side of the meat, seize
a mouthful in its jaws, and, by retracting its head violently,
would tear away the piece which it had grasped.</p>

<p>They are most destructive among fish, and are apt to rise
quietly underneath a fish as it basks near the surface of the
water, grasp it beneath with its sharp-edged jaws, and tear away
the piece, leaving the fish to die. It is rather remarkable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
the Lepidosiren, or mud-fish of the Gambia, destroys fish in a
precisely similar manner, though, as its jaws are much sharper
than those of the Emys, it does not need the aid of fore-paws in
biting out its mouthful of flesh.</p>

<p>Like the land Tortoise, it is one of the hibernators, and during
the winter months buries itself deeply in the earth, choosing
for this purpose the soft, muddy bed or bank of the pond in
which it lives.</p>

<p>Its eggs are white, and hard-shelled, but are more oval than
those of the land Tortoise, and both ends are nearly alike. In
fact, its egg might well be mistaken for that of a small pigeon.
The shell has a porcelain-like look, and is very liable to crack, so
that the resemblance is increased.</p>

<p>There is one drawback to these reptiles when kept as pets.
They give out a very unpleasant odour, which is disagreeable to
human nostrils, but is absolutely terrifying to many animals.
The monkey tribe have the strongest objection to these aquatic
Tortoises. I once held one of them towards a very tame
chimpanzee, much to his discomfiture. He muttered and remonstrated,
and retreated as far as he could, pushing out his
lips in a funnel-like form, and showing his repugnance to the
reptile in a manner that could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>Horses seem to be driven almost frantic with terror, not only
by the sight, but by the odour of these Tortoises. In Southern
Africa there are Tortoises closely allied to the Caspian Emys,
and having the same power of frightening horses.</p>

<p>I have read an account of an adventure there with one of
those Tortoises, which I will give. This variety is described as
being of an olive colour. When adult, there is a slight depression
on either side of the vertebral line.</p>

<p>"Some very awkward accidents have occurred to parties from
the terror caused by the fresh-water turtle (<em>Pelamedusa subrufa</em>).
Carts have been smashed to fragments, riders thrown, and the
utmost confusion caused by them. It is their smell, and it is
certainly very disagreeable.</p>

<p>"My first acquaintance with the fact was in this wise. I
was out shooting with two young ladies who had volunteered
as markers; and, as you know, all our shooting is done from
horseback. I had jumped off for a shot at some francolins
near a knill, or water-hole, and, after picking up my birds, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
coming round the knoll to windward of the horses. In my path
scrambled a turtle. I called out to my young friends, and told
them of my find, on which one of them, in a hasty voice, said,
'Oh, please, Mr. L., don't touch it; you will frighten the
horses!'</p>

<p>"Of course I laughed at the idea, and picked up the reptile,
which instantly emitted its pungent odour&mdash;its means of defence.
Though a long way off, the moment the horses caught
the scent, away they flew, showing terror in every action. The
girls, luckily splendid riders, tugged in vain at the reins; away
they went over the Veldt, leaving me in mortal fear that the
yawning 'aard-vark' holes (<em>Orycteropus capensis</em>) would break
their necks. My own horse, which I had hitched to a bush,
tore away his bridle, and with the ends streaming in the wind
and the stirrups clashing about him, sped off home at full
gallop, and was only recovered after a severe chase by my
gallant young Amazons, who, after a race of some miles, succeeded
in checking their affrighted steeds and in securing my runaway.
But for some hours after, if I ventured to windward, there were
wild-looking eyes and cocked ears&mdash;the smell of the reptile
clung to me."</p>

<p>Should any of my readers keep any of those water Tortoises,
they will do well to supply them plentifully with food, to give
them an elevated rocky perch on which they can scramble,
and on which they will sit for hours so motionless that at a
little distance they can scarcely be distinguished from the stone
on which they rest. They should also be weighed at regular
intervals, as decrease of weight is a sure sign that something is
wrong, and, as a general rule, is an almost certain precursor
of death.</p>

<p>This little reptile is not without its legends. According to
the old writers on natural history, it is of exceeding use to vine-growers
in the season when there is excess of rain or hail.
Whenever the owner of a vineyard sees a black cloud approaching,
all he has to do is, to take one of these Tortoises, lay it on
its back, and carry it round the vineyard. He must then go
into the middle of the ground and lay the reptile on the earth,
still on its back; and the effect of this proceeding would be that
the cloud would pass aside from a place so well protected.</p>

<p>"But," proceeds the narrator, not wishing to be responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
for the statement, "such diabolical and foolish observations
were not so muche to be remembered in this place, were it not
for their sillinesse, that by knowing them men might learn the
weaknesse of human wisdom when it erreth from the fountain of
all science and true knowledge (which is Divinity), and the
most approved assertions of nature. And so I will say no more
in this place of the sweet-water tortoise."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE DHUBB.</h2>


<p>We now come to the second animal, which may probably be
the Tzab of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>This creature is one of the lizards, and is a very odd-looking
creature. It is certainly not so attractive in appearance that
the Jews might be supposed to desire it as food; but it often
happens that, as is the case with the turtle and iguana, from
the most ungainly, in the latter animal even repulsive, forms are
produced the most delicate meats.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dhubb</span>, or <span class="smcap">Egyptian Mastigure</span>, as the lizard is indifferently
called, grows to a considerable size, measuring when adult
three feet in length. Its colour is green, variegated with brown,
and is slightly changeable, though not to the extent that distinguishes
the chameleon. The chief peculiarity of this lizard
consists in its tail, which is covered with a series of whorls or
circles of long, sharply-pointed, hard-edged scales. The very
appearance of this tail suggests its use as a weapon of defence,
and it is said that even the dreaded cerastes is conquered by it,
when the lizard and the snake happen to find themselves
occupants of the same hole.</p>

<p>The ancients had a very amusing notion respecting the use of
the spiny tail possessed by the Dhubb and its kin. They had
an idea that, comparatively small though it was, it fed upon
cattle, and that it was able to take them from the herd and
drive them to its home. For this purpose, when it had selected
an ox, it jumped on its back, and by the pricking of its sharp
claws drove the animal to gallop in hope of ridding himself of
his tormentor. In order to guide him in the direction of its
home, it made use of its tail, lashing the ox "to make him go
with his rider to the place of his most fit execution, free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
all rescue of his herdsman, or pastor, or the annoyance of passengers,
where, in most cruel and savage manner, he teareth the
limbs and parts one from another till he be devoured."</p>

<p>This very absurd account is headed by an illustration, which,
though bad in drawing and rude in execution, is yet so bold and
truthful that there is no doubt that it was sketched from the
living animal.</p>

<p>As it haunts sandy downs, rocky spots, and similar localities,
it is well adapted for the Holy Land, which is the home of a
vast number of reptiles, especially of those belonging to the
lizards. In the summer time they have the full enjoyment of
the hot sunbeams, in which they delight, and which seem to
rouse these cold-blooded creatures to action, while they deprive
the higher animals of all spirit and energy. In the winter time
these very spots afford localities wherein the lizards can hibernate
until the following spring, and in such a case they furnish the
reptiles with secure hiding-places.</p>

<p>Although the Dhubb does not destroy and tear to pieces oxen
and other cattle, it is yet a rather bloodthirsty reptile, and will
kill and devour birds as large as the domestic fowl. Usually,
however, its food consists of beetles and other insects, which it
takes deliberately.</p>

<p>The word <em>Leviathan</em> is used in a rather loose manner in the Old
Testament, in some places representing a mammalian of the sea,
and in others signifying a reptile inhabiting the rivers. As in
the most important of these passages the Crocodile is evidently
signified, we will accept that rendering, and consider the Crocodile
as being the Leviathan of Scripture. The Jewish Bible
accepts the word Crocodile, and does not add the mark of doubt.</p>

<p>The fullest account of the Leviathan occurs in Job xli., the
whole of which chapter is given to the description of the terrible
reptile. As the translation of the Jewish Bible differs in some
points from that of the Authorized Version, I shall here give
the former, so that the reader may be able to compare them with
each other.</p>

<p>This splendid description points as clearly to the Crocodile
as the description of the Behemoth which immediately precedes
it does to the hippopotamus, and it is tolerably evident that the
sacred poet who wrote these passages must have been personally
acquainted with both the Crocodile and the hippopotamus. In
both descriptions there are a few exaggerations, or rather, poetical
licences. For example, the bones of the hippopotamus are said
to be iron and copper, and the Crocodile is said to kindle live
coals with his breath. These, however, are but the natural
imagery of an Oriental poet, and, considering the subject, we
may rather wonder that the writer has not introduced even more
fanciful metaphors.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Description of the Crocodile.</span></p>

<p>There are several species of Crocodile in different parts of
the world, ten species at least being known to science.</p>

<p>Some inhabit India, some tropical America, some Asia, and
some Africa, so that the genus is represented in nearly all the
warmer parts of the world.</p>

<p>They are all known by the formation of the teeth, the lower
canines fitting each into a notch on the side of the upper jaw.
The feet are webbed to the tips, and though the reptile mostly
propels itself through the water by means of its tail, it can also
paddle itself gently along by means of its feet.</p>

<p>The teeth are all made for snatching and tearing, but not for
masticating, the Crocodile swallowing its prey entire when possible;
and when the animal is too large to be eaten entire, the
reptile tears it to pieces, and swallows the fragments without
attempting to masticate them.</p>

<p>In order to enable it to open its mouth under water, the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
of its throat is furnished with a very simple but beautiful contrivance,
whereby the water is received on a membranous valve
and, in proportion to its pressure, closes the orifice of the throat.
As the Crocodiles mostly seize their prey in their open jaws and
hold it under water until drowned, it is evident that without
such a structure as has been described the Crocodile would be
as likely to drown itself as its prey. But the throat-valve
enables it to keep its mouth open while the water is effectually
prevented from running down its throat, and the nostrils, placed
at the end of the snout, enable it to breathe at its ease, while
the unfortunate animal which it has captured is being drowned
beneath the surface of the water.</p>

<p>This position of the nostrils serves another purpose, and
enables the Crocodile to breathe while the whole of its body is
under the water, and only an inch or two of the very end of the
snout is above the surface. As, moreover, the Crocodile, as is
the case with most reptiles, is able to exist for a considerable
time without breathing, it only needs to protrude its nostrils for
a few moments, and can then sink entirely beneath the water.
In this way the reptile is able to conceal itself in case it should
suspect danger; and as, in such instances, it dives under the
herbage of the river, and merely thrusts its nose into the air
among the reeds and rushes, it is evident that, in spite of its
enormous size, it baffles the observation of almost every foe.</p>

<p>Among reptiles, the mailed Crocodiles may be mentioned as
most formidable foes to man. Vast in bulk, yet grovelling with
the belly on the earth; clad in bony plates with sharp ridges;
green eyes with a peculiar fiery stare, gleaming out from below
projecting orbits; lips altogether wanting, displaying the long
rows of interlocking teeth even when the mouth is closed, so
that, even when quiet, the monster seems to be grinning with
rage,&mdash;it is no wonder that the Crocodile should be, in all the
countries which it inhabits, viewed with dread.</p>

<p>Nor is this terror groundless. The Crocodiles, both of the Nile
and of the Indian rivers, are well known to make man their
victim, and scarcely can a more terrible fate be imagined than
that of falling into the jaws of this gigantic reptile. Strange as
it may appear, the Crocodile is one of the many animals to which
divine honours were paid by the ancient Egyptians. This we learn
from several sources. Herodotus, for example, in "Euterpe,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
chapter 69, writes as follows: "Those who dwell about Thebes and
Lake M&oelig;ris, consider them to be very sacred; and they each of
them train up a Crocodile, which is taught to be quite tame; and
they put crystal and gold ear-rings into their ears, and bracelets
on their fore-paws; and they give them appointed and sacred
food, and treat them as well as possible while alive and when
dead, they embalm them, and bury them in sacred vaults."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A CROCODILE POOL OF ANCIENT EGYPT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The reasons for this worship are several. At the root of them
all lies the tendency of man to respect that which he fears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
rather than that which he loves; and the nearer the man
approaches the savage state, the more is this feeling developed.
By this tendency his worship is regulated, and it will be found
that when man is sufficiently advanced to be capable of worship
at all, his reverence is invariably paid to the object which has
the greatest terrors for him. The Crocodile, therefore, being the
animal that was most dreaded by the ancient Egyptians, was
accepted as the natural type of divinity.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="nile" id="nile"></a>
<img src="images/i_590.jpg" width="400" height="369" alt="nile" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CROCODILES OF THE UPPER NILE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Owing to the accuracy of the description in the Book of Job,
which is evidently written by one who was personally acquainted
with the Crocodile, it is thought by many commentators that the
writer must have been acquainted with the Nile, in which river
both the Crocodile and hippopotamus are found at the present day.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that the hippopotamus and the Crocodile
have had at one time a much wider range than they at
present enjoy. Even within the memory of man the hippopotamus
has been driven further and further up the Nile by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
the encroachments of man. It has long been said that even at the
present day the Crocodile exists in Palestine in the river which
is called "Nhar Zurka," which flows from Samaria through the
plains of Sharon. Several of the older writers have mentioned
its existence in this river, and, since this work was commenced,
the long-vexed question has been set at rest; a Crocodile, eight
feet in length, having been captured in the Nhar Zurka.</p>

<p>No description of the Crocodile would be complete without allusion
to the mode in which it seizes its prey. It does not attack
it openly, neither, as some have said, does it go on shore for that
purpose. It watches to see whether any animal comes to drink,
and then, sinking beneath the surface of the water, dives rapidly,
rises unexpectedly beneath the unsuspecting victim, seizes it
with a sudden snap of its huge jaws, and drags it beneath the
water. Should the intended prey be too far from the water to
be reached by the mouth, or so large that it may offer a successful
resistance, the Crocodile strikes it a tremendous blow
with its tail, and knocks it into the water. The dwellers on the
Nile bank say that a large Crocodile will with a single blow of
its tail break all the four legs of an ox or a horse.</p>

<p>These cunning reptiles even contrive to catch birds as they
come for water. On the banks of the Nile the smaller birds
drink in a very peculiar manner. They settle in numbers on
the flexible branches that overhang the stream, and when, by
their weight, the branch bends downwards, they dip their beaks
in the water. The Crocodile sees afar off a branch thus loaded,
swims as near as possible, and then dives until it can see the
birds immediately above it, when it rises suddenly, and with a
snap of its jaws secures a whole mouthful of the unsuspecting
birds.</p>

<p>Sir S. Baker, in his travels on the Nile, gave much attention
to the Crocodile, and has collected a great amount of interesting
information about the reptile, much of which is peculiarly
valuable, inasmuch as it illustrates the Scriptural notices of
the creature. He states that it is a very crafty animal, and that
its usual mode of attack is by first showing itself, then swimming
slowly away to a considerable distance, so as to make its
intended victim think that danger is over, and then returning
under water. It is by means of this man&oelig;uvre that it captures
the little birds. It first makes a dash at them, open-mouthed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
causing them to take to flight in terror. It then sails slowly
away as if it were so baffled that it did not intend to renew the
attack. When it is at a considerable distance, the birds think
that their enemy has departed, and return to the branch, which
they crowd more than ever, and in a minute or two several dozen
of them are engulfed in the mouth of the Crocodile, which has
swiftly dived under them.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Sir S. Baker was walking near the edge of
the river, when he heard a great shrieking of women on the
opposite bank. It turned out that a number of women had
been filling their "gerbas" (water-skins), when one of them was
suddenly attacked by a large Crocodile. She sprang back, and
the reptile, mistaking the filled gerba for a woman, seized it, and
gave the owner time to escape. It then dashed at the rest of
the women, but only succeeded in seizing another gerba.</p>

<p>A short time previously a Crocodile, thought by the natives
to be the same individual, had seized a woman and carried her
off; and another had made an attack on a man in a very curious
manner. A number of men were swimming across the river,
supported, after their custom, on gerbas inflated with air, when
one of them felt himself seized by the leg by a Crocodile, which
tried to drag him under water. He, however, retained his hold
on the skin, and his companions also grasped his arms and hair
with one hand, while with the other they struck with their
spears at the Crocodile. At last they succeeded in driving the
reptile away, and got their unfortunate companion to land, where
they found that the whole of the flesh was stripped from the
leg from the knee downwards. The poor man died shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>Another traveller relates that three young men who were obliged
to cross a branch of a river in their route, being unable to procure
a boat, endeavoured to swim their horses to the opposite shore.
Two of them had reached the bank in safety, but the third loitered
so long on the brink as only to have just entered the water at the
moment his comrades had reached the opposite side. When he
was nearly half-way across, they saw a large Crocodile, which was
known to infest this pass, issuing from under the reeds. They
instantly warned their companion of his danger; but it was too
late for him to turn back. When the Crocodile was so close as
to be on the point of seizing him, he threw his saddle-bag to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
it. The ravenous animal immediately caught the whole bundle
in its jaws, and disappeared for a few moments, but soon discovered
its mistake, and rose in front of the horse, which, then seeing
it for the first time, reared and threw its rider. He was an
excellent swimmer, and had nearly escaped by diving towards
the bank; but, on rising for breath, his pursuer also rose, and
seized him by the middle. This dreadful scene, which passed
before the eyes of his companions, without the least possibility
of their rendering any assistance, was terminated by the Crocodile,
having previously drowned the unfortunate man, appearing on
an opposite sand-bank with the body, and there devouring it.</p>

<p>The crafty Crocodile tries to catch the baboons by lying in
wait for them at their drinking places; but the baboons are
generally more than a match for the Crocodile in point of
cunning and quickness of sight. Sir S. Baker witnessed an
amusing example of such an attempt and its failure.</p>

<p>"The large tamarind-trees on the opposite bank are generally
full of the dog-faced baboons (<em>Cynocephalus</em>) at their drinking
hour. I watched a large Crocodile creep slily out of the water
and lie in waiting among the rocks at the usual drinking place
before they arrived, but the baboons were too wide awake to be
taken in so easily.</p>

<p>"A young fellow was the first to discover the enemy. He
had accompanied several wise and experienced old hands to
the extremity of a bough that at a considerable height overhung
the river; from this post they had a bird's eye view,
and reconnoitred before one of the numerous party descended
to drink. The sharp eyes of the young one at once detected
the Crocodile, who matched in colour so well with the rocks
that most probably a man would not have noticed it until
too late.</p>

<p>"At once the young one commenced shaking the bough and
screaming with all his might, to attract the attention of the
Crocodile and to induce it to move. In this he was immediately
joined by the whole party, who yelled in chorus, while the large
old males bellowed defiance, and descended to the lowest branches
within eight or ten feet of the Crocodile. It was of no use&mdash;the
pretender never stirred, and I watched it until dark. It
remained still in the same place, waiting for some unfortunate
baboon whose thirst might provoke his fate, but not one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
sufficiently foolish, although the perpendicular bank prevented
them from drinking except at that particular spot."</p>

<p>It may be imagined that if the Crocodile were to depend
entirely for its food upon the animals that it catches on the bank
or in the river, it would run a risk of starving. The fact is, that
its principal food consists of fish, which it can chase in the water.
The great speed at which the Crocodile darts through the water
is not owing to its webbed feet, but to its powerful tail, which
is swept from side to side, and thus propels the reptile after
the manner of a man "sculling" a boat with a single oar in
the stern. The whales and the fishes have a similar mode of
propulsion.</p>

<p>On land, the tail is the Crocodile's most formidable weapon.
It is one mass of muscle and sinew, and the force of its lateral
stroke is terrible, sweeping away every living thing that it may
meet. Fortunately for its antagonists, the Crocodile can turn
but very slowly, so that, although it can scramble along at a
much faster pace than its appearance indicates, there is no great
difficulty in escaping, provided that the sweep of its tail be
avoided. As the Crocodile of the Nile attains when adult a
length of thirty feet, one moiety of which is taken up by the
tail, it may easily be imagined that the power of this weapon
can scarcely be exaggerated.</p>

<p>As if to add to the terrors of the animal, its head, back, and
tail are shielded by a series of horny scales, which are set so
closely together that the sharpest spear can seldom find its way
through them, and even the rifle ball glances off, if it strikes
them obliquely. Like many other reptiles, the Crocodile is
hatched from eggs which are laid on shore and vivified by the
warmth of the sun.</p>

<p>These eggs are exceedingly small when compared with the
gigantic lizard which deposited them, scarcely equalling in
dimensions those of the goose. There is now before me an egg
of the cayman of South America, a fresh-water lizard but little
smaller than the Crocodile of the Nile, and this is barely equal
in size to an ordinary hen's egg. It is longer in proportion to
its width, but the contents of the two eggs would be as nearly
as possible of the same bulk. On the exterior it is very rough,
having a granulated appearance, not unlike that of dried sharkskin,
and the shell is exceedingly thin and brittle. The lining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
membrane, however, is singularly thick and tough, so that the
egg is tolerably well defended against fracture.</p>

<p>When first hatched, the young Crocodile is scarcely larger
than a common newt, but it attains most formidable dimensions
in a very short time. Twenty or thirty eggs are laid in one
spot, and, were they not destroyed by sundry enemies, the
Crocodiles would destroy every living creature in the rivers.
Fortunately, the eggs and young have many enemies, chiefly
among which is the well-known ichneumon, which discovers the
place where the eggs are laid and destroys them, and eats any
young Crocodiles that it can catch before they succeed in making
their way to the water.</p>

<p>The old writers were aware of the services rendered by the
ichneumon, but, after their wont, exaggerated them by additions
of their own, saying that the ichneumon enters into the mouth
of the Crocodile as it lies asleep, and eats its way through the
body, "putting the Crocodile to exquisite and intolerable torment,
while the Crocodile tumbleth to and fro, sighing and weeping,
now in the depth of water, now on the land, never resting till
strength of nature faileth. For the incessant gnawing of the
ichneumon so provoketh her to seek her rest in the unrest of
every part, herb, element, throws, throbs, rollings, but all in
vain, for the enemy within her breatheth through her breath,
and sporteth herself in the consumption of those vital parts
which waste and wear away by yielding to unpacificable teeth,
one after another, till she that crept in by stealth at the mouth,
like a puny thief, comes out at the belly like a conqueror,
through a passage opened by her own labour and industry."</p>

<p>The author has in the long passage, a part of which is here
quoted, mentioned that the ichneumon takes its opportunity of
entering the jaws of the Crocodile as it lies with its mouth open
against the beams of the sun. It is very true that the Crocodile
does sleep with its mouth open; and, in all probability, the
older observers, knowing that the ichneumon did really destroy
the eggs and young of the Crocodile, only added a little amplification,
and made up their minds that it also destroyed the
parents. The same writer who has lately been quoted ranks the
ibis among the enemies of the Crocodile, and says that the bird
affects the reptile with such terror that, if but an ibis's feather
be laid on its back, the Crocodile becomes rigid and unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a><br /><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
move. The Arabs of the present time say that the water-tortoises
are enemies to the eggs, scratching them out of the sand and eating
them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ICHNEUMON DEVOURING THE EGGS OF THE CROCODILE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As this reptile is so dangerous a neighbour to the inhabitants
of the river-banks, many means have been adopted for its destruction.</p>

<p>One such method, where a kind of harpoon is employed, is
described by a traveller in the East as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most favourable season for thus hunting the Crocodile is
either the winter, when the animal usually sleeps on sand-banks,
luxuriating in the rays of the sun, or the spring, after the pairing
time, when the female regularly watches the sand islands where
she has buried her eggs.</p>

<p>"The native hunter finds out the place and conceals himself by
digging a hole in the sand near the spot where the animal usually
lies. On its arrival at the accustomed spot the hunter darts his
harpoon or spear with all his force, for, in order that its stroke
may be successful, the iron should penetrate to a depth of at least
four inches, in order that the barb may be fixed firmly in the flesh.</p>

<p>"The Crocodile, on being wounded, rushes into the water, and
the huntsman retreats into a canoe, with which a companion has
hastened to his assistance.</p>

<p>"A piece of wood attached to the harpoon by a long cord swims
on the water and shows the direction in which the Crocodile is
moving. The hunters pull on this rope and drag the beast to the
surface of the water, where it is again pierced by a second harpoon.</p>

<p>"When the animal is struck it by no means remains inactive;
on the contrary, it lashes instantly with its tail, and endeavours to
bite the rope asunder. To prevent this, the rope is made of about
thirty separate slender lines, not twisted together, but merely placed
in juxtaposition, and bound around at intervals of every two feet.
The thin strands get between the Crocodile's teeth, and it is unable
to sever them.</p>

<p>"In spite of the great strength of the reptile, two men can drag
a tolerably large one out of the water, tie up his mouth, twist his
legs over his back, and kill him by driving a sharp steel spike into
the spinal cord just at the back of the skull.</p>

<p>"There are many other modes of capturing the Crocodile, one
of which is the snare portrayed in the illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two elastic saplings are bent down and kept in position by
stout cords, one of which, bears a baited hook, while the other is
fashioned into a noose. These cords are so arranged as to release
the bent saplings as soon as the Crocodile pulls upon the baited
hook. If all works properly, the animal suddenly finds himself
suspended in the air, where he remains helpless and at the mercy
of the hunter, who soon arrives and despatches him.</p>

<p>"The extreme tenacity of life possessed by the Crocodile is well
exemplified by an incident which occurred in Ceylon. A fine
specimen had been caught, and to all appearance killed, its interior
parts removed, and the aperture kept open by a stick placed
across it. A few hours afterwards the captors returned to their
victim with the intention of cutting off the head, but were surprised
to find the spot vacant. On examining the locality it was
evident that the creature had retained sufficient life to crawl back
into the water. From this it may be imagined that it is no easy
matter to drive the breath out of a Crocodile. Its life seems to
take a separate hold of every fibre in the creature's body, and
though pierced through and through with bullets, crushed by
heavy blows, and its body converted into a very pincushion for
spears, it writhes and twists and struggles with wondrous strength,
snapping savagely with its huge jaws, and lashing its muscular
tail from side to side with such vigour that it requires a bold
man to venture within range of that terrible weapon."</p>

<p>Sometimes combats occur between this creature and the tiger,
one of the fiercest and most terrible of all quadrupeds. Tigers
frequently go down to the rivers to drink, and, upon these occasions,
the Crocodile, if near, may attempt to seize them. The
ferocious beast, however, seldom falls unrevenged; for the instant
he finds himself seized, he turns with great agility and fierceness
on his enemy, and endeavours to strike his claws into the Crocodile's
eyes, while the latter drags him into the water, where they
continue to struggle until the tiger be drowned, and his triumphant
antagonist feasts upon his carcass. Such a combat is depicted in
the illustration which appears on an accompanying page.</p>

<h2>THE LETÂÂH OR LIZARD.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Difficulty of identifying the Letââh&mdash;Probability that it is a collective and not a
specific term&mdash;Various Lizards of Palestine&mdash;The Green or Jersey Lizard&mdash;The
Cyprius, its appearance and habits&mdash;The Glass Snake or Scheltopusic&mdash;Translation

uses of the Lizard&mdash;The Seps tribe&mdash;The common Cicigna, and the popular
belief concerning its habits&mdash;The Sphænops and its shallow tunnel.</p></blockquote>


<p>In Leviticus xi. 30, the word <span class="smcap">Lizard</span> is used as the rendering of
the Hebrew word <em>letââh</em> (pronounced as L'tâh-âh). There are
one or two difficulties about the word, but, without going into
the question of etymology, which is beside the object of this
work, it will be sufficient to state that the best authorities accept
the rendering, and that in the Jewish Bible the word Lizard is
retained, but with the mark of doubt appended to it.</p>

<p>A very common species of Lizard, and therefore likely to be
one of those which are grouped under the common name of Letââh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
is the <span class="smcap">Cyprius</span> (<em>Plestiodon auratum</em>). This handsome Lizard is
golden-yellow in colour, beautifully spotted with orange and
scarlet, and may be distinguished, even when the colours have
fled after death, by the curiously formed ears, which are strongly
toothed in front. It is very plentiful in Palestine, and, like
others of its kin, avoids cultivated tracts, and is generally found
on rocky and sandy soil which cannot be tilled. It is active,
and, if alarmed, hides itself quickly in the sand or under stones.</p>

<p>It belongs to the great family of the Skinks, many of which,
like the familiar blind-worm of our own country, are without
external legs, and, though true Lizards, progress in a snake-like
manner, and are generally mistaken for snakes. One of these is
the <span class="smcap">Glass Snake</span> or <span class="smcap">Scheltopusic</span> (<em>Pseudopus pallasii</em>), which
has two very tiny hind legs, but which is altogether so snake-like
that it is considered by the natives to be really a serpent.
They may well be excused for their error, as the only external
indications of limbs are a pair of slightly-projecting scales at the
place where the hind legs would be in a fully-developed Lizard.</p>

<p>Though tolerably plentiful, the Scheltopusic is not very often
seen, as it is timid and wary, and, when it suspects danger, glides
away silently into some place of safety. When adult, the colour
of this Lizard is usually chestnut, profusely mottled with black
or deep brown, the edge of each scale being of the darker colour.
It feeds upon insects and small reptiles, and has been known to
devour a nest full of young birds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Levit. xi. 30 is a Hebrew word, <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">chomet</i>, which is given in
the Authorized Version as <span class="smcap">Snail</span>. There is, however, no doubt
that the word is wrongly translated, and that by it some species
of Lizard is signified. The Jewish Bible follows the Authorized
Version, but affixes the mark of doubt to the word. There is
another word, <em>shablul</em>, which undoubtedly does signify the snail,
and will be mentioned in its proper place.</p>

<p>It is most probable that the word <em>chomet</em> includes, among
other Lizards, many of the smaller Skinks which inhabit Palestine.
Among them we may take as an example the <span class="smcap">Common
Skink</span> (<em>Scincus officinalis</em>), a reptile which derives its specific
name from the fact that it was formerly used in medicine,
together with mummy, and the other disgusting ingredients
which formed the greater part of the old Pharmacop&oelig;ia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<p>Even at the present day, it is used for similar purposes in the
East, and is in consequence captured for the use of physicians,
the body being simply dried in the sun, and then sent to market
for sale. It is principally employed for the cure of sunstroke,
nettle-rash, sand-blindness, or fever, and both patient and physician
have the greatest confidence in its powers. It is said by
some European physicians that the flesh of the Skink really
does possess medicinal powers, and that it has fallen into disrepute
chiefly because those powers have been exaggerated. In
former days, the head and feet were thought to possess the
greatest efficacy, and were valued accordingly.</p>

<p>Like all its tribe, the Skink loves sandy localities, the soil
exactly suiting its peculiar habits. Although tolerably active, it
does not run so fast or so far as many other Lizards, and, when
alarmed, it has a peculiar faculty for sinking itself almost instantaneously
under the sand, much after the fashion of the shore-crabs
of our own country. Indeed, it is even more expeditious
than the crab, which occupies some little time in burrowing
under the wet and yielding sand, whereas the Skink slips
beneath the dry and comparatively hard sand with such rapidity
that it seems rather to be diving into a nearly excavated burrow
than to be scooping a hollow for itself.</p>

<p>The sand is therefore a place of safety to the Skink, which
does not, like the crab, content itself with merely burying its
body just below the surface, but continues to burrow, sinking
itself in a few seconds to the depth of nearly a yard.</p>

<p>The length of the Skink is about eight inches, and its very
variable colour is generally yellowish brown, crossed with several
dark bands. Several specimens, however, are spotted instead of
banded with brown, while some are banded with white, and
others are spotted with white. In all, however, the under-surface
is silver grey.</p>

<h2>THE CHAMELEON, MONITOR, AND GECKO.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Demeanour of the Chameleon on the ground&mdash;The independent eyes&mdash;Its frequent
change of colour&mdash;The Nilotic Monitor.</p></blockquote>


<p>In Levit. xi. 30 there occurs a word which has caused great
trouble to commentators. The word is <em>koach</em>.</p>

<p>There are two lizards to which the term may possibly be
applied&mdash;namely, the Chameleon and the Monitor; and, as the
Authorized Version of the Scriptures accepts the former interpretation,
we will first describe the Chameleon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This reptile is very plentiful in the Holy Land, as well as in
Egypt, so that the Israelites would be perfectly familiar with it,
both during their captivity and after their escape. It is but a
small reptile, and the reader may well ask why a name denoting
strength should be given to it. I think that we may find the
reason for its name in the extraordinary power of its grasp, as it
is able, by means of its peculiarly-formed feet and prehensile tail,
to grasp the branches so tightly that it can scarcely be removed
without damage.</p>

<p>I once saw six or seven Chameleons huddled up together, all
having clasped each other's legs and tails so firmly that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
formed a bundle that might be rolled along the ground without
being broken up. In order to show the extraordinary power of
the Chameleon's grasp, I have had a figure drawn from a sketch
taken by myself from a specimen which I kept for several
months.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="gecko" id="gecko"></a>
<img src="images/i_605.jpg" width="400" height="413" alt="gecko" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">GECKO AND CHAMELEON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the Chameleon wished to pass from one branch to
another, it used to hold firmly to the branch by the tail and one
hind-foot, and stretch out its body nearly horizontally, feeling
about with the other three feet, as if in search of a convenient
resting-place. In this curious attitude it would remain for a
considerable time, apparently suffering no inconvenience, though
even the spider-monkey would have been unable to maintain
such an attitude for half the length of time.</p>

<p>The strength of the grasp is really astonishing when contrasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
with the size of the reptile, as any one will find who
allows the Chameleon to grasp his finger, or who tries to detach
it from the branch to which it is clinging. The feet are most
curiously made. They are furnished with five toes, which are
arranged like those of parrots and other climbing birds, so as to
close upon each other like the thumb and finger of a human
hand. They are armed with little yellow claws, slightly curved
and very sharp, and when they grasp the skin of the hand they
give it an unpleasantly sharp pinch.</p>

<p>The tail is as prehensile as that of the spider-monkey, to
which the Chameleon bears a curious resemblance in some of
its attitudes, though nothing can be more different than the
volatile, inquisitive, restless disposition of the spider-monkey
and the staid, sober demeanour of the Chameleon. The reptile
has the power of guiding the tail to any object as correctly as if
there were an eye at the end of the tail. When it has been
travelling over the branches of trees, I have often seen it direct
its tail to a projecting bud, and grasp it as firmly as if the bud
had been before and not behind it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when it rests on a branch, it allows the tail to
hang down as a sort of balance, the tip coiling and uncoiling
unceasingly. But, as soon as the reptile wishes to move, the
tail is tightened to the branch, and at once coiled round it.
There really seems to be almost a separate vitality and consciousness
on the part of the tail, which glides round an object
as if it were acting with entire independence of its owner.</p>

<p>On the ground the Chameleon fares but poorly. Its walk is
absolutely ludicrous, and an experienced person might easily
fail to identify a Chameleon when walking with the same
animal on a branch. It certainly scrambles along at a tolerable
rate, but it is absurdly awkward, its legs sprawling
widely on either side, and its feet grasping futilely at every
step. The tail, which is usually so lithe and nimble, is then
held stiffly from the body, with a slight curve upwards.</p>

<p>The eyes are strange objects, projecting far from the head,
and each acting quite independently of the other, so that one
eye may often be directed forwards, and the other backwards.
The eyeballs are covered with a thick wrinkled skin, except a
small aperture at the tip, which can be opened and closed like
our own eyelids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>The changing colour of the Chameleon has been long known,
though there are many mistaken ideas concerning it.</p>

<p>The reptile does not necessarily assume the colour of any
object on which it is placed, but sometimes takes a totally
different colour. Thus, if my Chameleon happened to come
upon any scarlet substance, the colour immediately became
black, covered with innumerable circular spots of light yellow.
The change was so instantaneous that, as it crawled on the
scarlet cloth, the colour would alter, and the fore-part of the
body would be covered with yellow spots, while the hinder
parts retained their dull black. Scarlet always annoyed the
Chameleon, and it tried to escape whenever it found itself
near any substance of the obnoxious hue.</p>

<p>The normal colour was undoubtedly black, with a slight tinge
of grey. But in a short time the whole creature would become
a vivid verdigris green, and, while the spectator was watching it,
the legs would become banded with rings of bright yellow, and
spats and streaks of the same colour would appear on the head
and body.</p>

<p>When it was excited either by anger or by expectation&mdash;as,
for example, when it heard a large fly buzzing near it&mdash;the
colours were singularly beautiful, almost exactly resembling in
hue and arrangement those of the jaguar. Of all the colours,
green seemed generally to predominate, but the creature would
pass so rapidly from one colour to another that it was scarcely
possible to follow the various gradations of hue.</p>

<p>Some persons have imagined that the variation of colour
depends on the wants and passions of the animal. This is not
the case. The change is often caused by mental emotion, but is
not dependent on it; and I believe that the animal has no
control whatever over its colour. The best proof of this assertion
may be found in the fact that my own Chameleon changed
colour several times after its death; and, indeed, as long as
I had the dead body before me, changes of hue were taking
place.</p>

<p>The food of the Chameleon consists of insects, mostly flies,
which it catches by means of its tongue, which can be protruded
to an astonishing distance. The tongue is nearly cylindrical,
and is furnished at the tip with a slight cavity, which is filled
with a very glutinous secretion. When the Chameleon sees a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a><br /><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
fly or other insect, it gently protrudes the tongue once or twice,
as if taking aim, like a billiard-player with his cue, and then,
with a moderately smart stroke, carries off the insect on the
glutinous tip of the tongue. The force with which the Chameleon
strikes is really wonderful. My own specimen used to look for
flies from my hand, and at first I was as much surprised with
the force of the blow struck by the tongue as I was with the
grasping power of the feet.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GECKO.<br />

FOOT OF THE GECKO&mdash;UNDER SIDE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>So much for the Chameleon. We will now take the <span class="smcap">Nilotic
Monitor</span> and the <span class="smcap">Land Monitor</span>, the other reptiles which have
been conjectured to be the real representatives of the Koach.</p>

<p>These lizards attain to some size, the former sometimes measuring
six feet in length, and the latter but a foot or so less. Of
the two, the Land Monitor, being the more common, both in
Palestine and Egypt, has perhaps the best claim to be considered
as the Koach of Scripture. It is sometimes called the Land
Crocodile. It is a carnivorous animal, feeding upon other reptiles
and the smaller mammalia, and is very fond of the eggs of
the crocodile, which it destroys in great numbers, and is in consequence
much venerated by the inhabitants of the country
about the Nile.</p>

<p>The theory that this reptile may be the Koach of Leviticus is
strengthened by the fact that even at the present day it is
cooked and eaten by the natives, whereas the chameleon is so
small and bony that scarcely any one would take the trouble of
cooking it.</p>

<p>The Gecko takes its name from the sound which it utters,
resembling the word "geck-o." It is exceedingly plentiful, and
inhabits the interior of houses, where it can find the flies and
other insects on which it lives. On account of the structure of
the toes, each of which is flattened into a disk-like form, and
furnished on the under surface with a series of plates like those
on the back of the sucking-fish, it can walk up a smooth, perpendicular
wall with perfect ease, and can even cling to the ceiling
like the flies on which it feeds.</p>

<p>In the illustration the reader will observe the flat, fan-like
expansions at the ends of the toes, by which the Gecko is able
to adhere to flat surfaces, and to dart with silent rapidity from
place to place.</p>

<h2>SERPENTS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Serpents in general&mdash;The fiery Serpents of the wilderness&mdash;Explanation of the
words "flying" and "fiery" as applied to Serpents&mdash;Haunts of the Serpent&mdash;The
Cobra, or Asp of Scripture&mdash;The Cerastes, or Horned Serpent&mdash;Appearance
and habits of the reptile&mdash;The "Adder in the path."</p></blockquote>


<p>As we have seen that so much looseness of nomenclature prevailed
among the Hebrews even with regard to the mammalia,
birds, and lizards, we can but expect that the names of the
Serpents will be equally difficult to identify.</p>

<p>No less than seven names are employed in the Old Testament
to denote some species of Serpent; but there are only two which
can be identified with any certainty, four others being left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
mere conjecture, and one being clearly a word which, like our
snake or serpent, is a word not restricted to any particular
species, but signifying Serpents in general. This word is <em>nâchâsh</em>
(pronounced nah-kahsh). It is unfortunate that the word is so
variously translated in different passages of Scripture, and we
cannot do better than to follow it through the Ola Testament, so
as to bring all the passages under our glance.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Nâchâsh occurs in Gen. iii., in the
well-known passage where the Serpent is said to be more subtle
than all the beasts of the field, the wisdom or subtlety of the
Serpent having evidently an allegorical and not a categorical
signification. We find the same symbolism employed in the
New Testament, the disciples of our Lord being told to be "wise
as serpents, and harmless as doves."</p>

<p>Allusion is made to the gliding movement of the Serpent tribe
in Prov. xxx. 19. On this part of the subject little need be said,
except that the movements of the Serpent are owing to the
mobility of the ribs, which are pushed forward in succession and
drawn back again, so as to catch against any inequality of the
ground. This power is increased by the structure of the scales.
Those of the upper part of the body, which are not used for
locomotion, are shaped something like the scales of a fish; but
those of the lower part of the body, which come in contact with
the ground, are broad belts, each overlapping the other, and each
connected with one pair of ribs.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Serpent pushes forward the ribs, the
edges of the scaly belts will catch against the slightest projection,
and are able to give a very powerful impetus to the
body. It is scarcely possible to drag a snake backwards over
rough ground; while on a smooth surface, such as glass, the
Serpent would be totally unable to proceed. This, however, was
not likely to have been studied by the ancient Hebrews, who
were among the most unobservant of mankind with regard to
details of natural history: it is, therefore, no wonder that the
gliding of the Serpent should strike the writer of the proverb in
question as a mystery which he could not explain.</p>

<p>The poisonous nature of some of the Serpents is mentioned in
several passages of Scripture; and it will be seen that the ancient
Hebrews, like many modern Europeans, believed that the poison
lay in the forked tongue. See, for example, Ps. lviii. 4: "Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
poison is like the poison of a serpent" (<em>nâchâsh</em>). Also Prov.
xxiii. 32, in which the sacred writer says of wine that it brings
woe, sorrow, contentions, wounds without cause, redness of eyes,
and that "at the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like
an adder."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="asp" id="asp"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">COBRA AND CERASTES, THE ASP AND ADDER OF SCRIPTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The idea that the poison of the Serpent lies in the tongue is
seen in several passages of Scripture. "They have sharpened
their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips"
(Ps. cxl. 3). Also in Job xx. 16, the sacred writer says of the
hypocrite, that "he shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's
tongue shall slay him."</p>

<p>As to the fiery Serpents of the wilderness, it is scarcely needful
to mention that the epithet of "fiery" does not signify that the
Serpents in question produced real fire from their mouths, but
that allusion is made to the power and virulence of their poison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
and to the pain caused by their bite. We ourselves naturally
employ a similar metaphor, and speak of a "burning pain," of a
"fiery trial," of "hot anger," and the like.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ISRAELITES ARE BITTEN BY SERPENTS IN THE WILDERNESS, AND MOSES LIFTS
UP THE SERPENT OF BRASS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The epithet of "flying" which is applied to these Serpents is
explained by the earlier commentators as having reference to a
Serpent which they called the Dart Snake, and which they
believed to lie in wait for men and to spring at them from a
distance. They thought that this snake hid itself either in
hollows of the ground or in trees, and sprang through the air
for thirty feet upon any man or beast that happened to pass by.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now take the various species of Serpents mentioned
in the Bible, as nearly as they can be identified.</p>

<p>Of one species there is no doubt whatever. This is the Cobra
di Capello, a serpent which is evidently signified by the Hebrew
word <em>pethen</em>.</p>

<p>This celebrated Serpent has long been famous, not only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
deadly power of its venom, but for the singular performances in
which it takes part. The Cobra inhabits many parts of Asia, and
in almost every place where it is found, certain daring men take
upon themselves the profession of serpent-charmers, and handle
these fearful reptiles with impunity, cause them to move in time
to certain musical sounds, and assert that they bear a life charmed
against the bite of these deadly playmates.</p>

<p>One of these men will take a Cobra in his bare hands, toss it
about with perfect indifference, allow it to twine about his naked
breast, tie it around his neck, and treat it with as little ceremony
as if it were an earth-worm. He will then take the same Serpent&mdash;or
apparently the same&mdash;make it bite a fowl, which soon dies from
the poison, and will then renew his performance.</p>

<p>Some persons say that the whole affair is but an exhibition of
that jugglery in which the natives of the East Indies are such
wondrous adepts; that the Serpents with which the man plays are
harmless, having been deprived of their fangs, and that a really
venomous specimen is adroitly substituted for the purpose of killing
the fowl. It is, moreover, said, and truly, that a snake thought
to have been rendered harmless by the deprivation of its fangs,
has bitten one of its masters and killed him, thus proving the
imposture.</p>

<p>Still, neither of these explanations will entirely disprove the
mastery of man over a venomous Serpent.</p>

<p>In the first instance, it is surely as perilous an action to substitute
a venomous Serpent as to play with it. Where was it hidden,
why did it not bite the man instead of the fowl, and how did the
juggler prevent it from using its teeth while he was conveying it
away?</p>

<p>And, in the second instance, the detection of one impostor is by
no means a proof that all who pretend to the same powers are
likewise impostors.</p>

<p>The following narrative by a traveller in the East seems to
prove that the serpent-charmer possessed sufficient power to induce
a truly poisonous Serpent to leave its hole, and to perform certain
antics at his command:</p>

<p>"A snake-charmer came to my bungalow, requesting me to
allow him to show his snakes. As I had frequently seen his
performance, I declined to witness a repetition of it, but told
him that if he would accompany me to the jungle and catch a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
Cobra, that I knew frequented the place, I would give him a
present of money. He was quite willing, and as I was anxious
to test the truth of the charm he claimed to possess, I carefully
counted his tame snakes, and put a guard over them until we
should return.</p>

<p>"Before starting I also examined his clothing, and satisfied
myself that he had no snake about his person. When we arrived
at the spot, he commenced playing upon a small pipe, and, after
persevering for some time, out crawled a large Cobra from an
ant-hill which I knew it occupied.</p>

<p>"On seeing the man it tried to escape, but he quickly caught it
by the tail and kept swinging it round until we reached the bungalow.
He then laid it upon the ground and made it raise and
lower its head to the sound of his pipe.</p>

<p>"Before long, however, it bit him above the knee. He immediately
bandaged the leg tightly above the wound, and applied a piece
of porous stone, called a snake-stone, to extract the poison. He was
in great pain for a few minutes, but afterwards it gradually subsided,
the stone falling from the wound just before he was relieved.</p>

<p>"When he recovered he held up a cloth, at which the snake flew
and hung by its fangs. While in this position the man passed his
hand up its back, and having seized it tightly by the throat, he
pulled out the fangs and gave them to me. He then squeezed out
the poison, from the glands in the Serpent's mouth, upon a leaf.
It was a clear, oily substance, which when rubbed with the hand
produced a fine lather.</p>

<p>"The whole operation was carefully watched by me, and was
also witnessed by several other persons."</p>

<p>How the serpent-charmers perform their feats is not very
intelligible. That they handle the most venomous Serpents with
perfect impunity is evident enough, and it is also clear that they
are able to produce certain effects upon the Serpents by means
of musical (or unmusical) sounds. But these two items are
entirely distinct, and one does not depend upon the other.</p>

<p>In the first place, the handling of venomous snakes has been
performed by ordinary men without the least recourse to any
arts except that of acquaintance with the habits of Serpents.
The late Mr. Waterton, for example, would take up a rattlesnake
in his bare hand without feeling the least uneasy as to the
behaviour of his prisoner. He once took twenty-seven rattlesnakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a><br /><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
out of a box, carried them into another room, put them
into a large glass case, and afterwards replaced them in the
box. He described to me the manner in which he did it, using
my wrist as the representative of the Serpent.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 383px;"><a name="charmer" id="charmer"></a>
<img src="images/i_618.jpg" width="383" height="600" alt="charmer" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SERPENT-CHARMER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The nature of all Serpents is rather peculiar, and is probably
owing to the mode in which the blood circulates. They are
extremely unwilling to move, except when urged by the wants of
nature, and will lie coiled up for many hours together when
not pressed by hunger. Consequently, when touched, their
feeling is evidently like that of a drowsy man, who only tries
to shake off the object which may rouse him, and composes
himself afresh to sleep.</p>

<p>A quick and sudden movement would, however, alarm the
reptile, which would strike in self-defence, and, sluggish as are
its general movements, its stroke is delivered with such lightning
rapidity that it would be sure to inflict its fatal wound
before it was seized.</p>

<p>If, therefore, Mr. Waterton saw a Serpent which he desired to
catch, he would creep very quietly up to it, and with a gentle,
slow movement place his fingers round its neck just behind the
head. If it happened to be coiled up in such a manner that he
could not get at its neck, he had only to touch it gently until it
moved sufficiently for his purpose.</p>

<p>When he had once placed his hand on the Serpent, it was
in his power. He would then grasp it very lightly indeed,
and raise it gently from the ground, trusting that the reptile
would be more inclined to be carried quietly than to summon
up sufficient energy to bite. Even if it had tried to use its
fangs, it could not have done so as long as its captor's fingers
were round its neck.</p>

<p>As a rule, a great amount of provocation is needed before a
venomous Serpent will use its teeth. One of my friends, when
a boy, caught a viper, mistaking it for a common snake. He
tied it round his neck, coiled it on his wrist by way of a bracelet,
and so took it home, playing many similar tricks with it as he
went. After arrival in the house, he produced the viper for the
amusement of his brothers and sisters, and, after repeating his
performances, tried to tie the snake in a double knot. This, however,
was enough to provoke the most pacific of creatures, and in
consequence he received a bite on his finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span></p>

<p>The poison was not slow to take effect; first, the wound looked
and felt like a nettle sting, then like a wasp sting, and in the
course of a few minutes the whole finger was swollen. At this
juncture his father, a medical man, fortunately arrived, and set
the approved antidotes, ammonia, oil, and lunar caustic, to the
wound, having previously made incisions about the punctured
spot, and with paternal affection attempted to suck out the poison.
In spite of these remedies a serious illness was the result of the
bite, from which the boy did not recover for several weeks.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="viper" id="viper"></a>
<img src="images/i_620.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="viper" />
</div>

<p>There is no doubt that the snake-charmers trust chiefly to
this sluggish nature of the reptile, but they certainly go through
some ceremonies by which they believe themselves to be rendered
impervious to snake-bites. They will coil the cobra round
their naked bodies, they will irritate the reptile until it is in a
state of fury; they will even allow it to bite them, and yet be
none the worse for the wound. Then, as if to show that the
venomous teeth have not been abstracted, as is possibly supposed
to be the case, they will make the cobra bite a fowl,
which speedily dies from the effects of the poison.</p>

<p>Even if the fangs were extracted, the Serpents would lose
little of their venomous power. These reptiles are furnished
with a whole series of fangs in different stages of development,
so that when the one in use is broken or shed in the course of
nature, another comes forward and fills its place. There is now
before me a row of four fangs, which I took from the right upper
jawbone of a viper which I recently caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>In her interesting "Letters from Egypt," Lady Duff-Gordon
gives an amusing account of the manner in which she was
formally initiated into the mysteries of snake-charming, and
made ever afterwards impervious to the bite of venomous
Serpents:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Kóm Omboo, we met with a Rifáee darweesh with his
basket of tame snakes. After a little talk, he proposed to
initiate me: and so we sat down and held hands like people
marrying. Omar [her attendant] sat behind me, and repeated
the words as my 'wakeel.' Then the Rifáee twisted a cobra
round our joined hands, and requested me to spit on it; he did
the same, and I was pronounced safe and enveloped in snakes.
My sailors groaned, and Omar shuddered as the snakes put out
their tongues; the darweesh and I smiled at each other like
Roman augurs."</p>

<p>She believed that the snakes were toothless; and perhaps on
this occasion they may have been so. Extracting the teeth of
the Serpent is an easy business in experienced hands, and is
conducted in two ways. Those snake-charmers who are confident
of their own powers merely grasp the reptile by the neck,
force open its jaws with a piece of stick, and break off the fangs,
which are but loosely attached to the jaw. Those who are not
so sure of themselves irritate the snake, and offer it a piece of
cloth, generally the corner of their mantle, to bite. The snake
darts at it, and, as it seizes the garment, the man gives the cloth
a sudden jerk, and so tears away the fangs.</p>

<p>Still, although some of the performers employ mutilated
snakes, there is no doubt that others do not trouble themselves
to remove the fangs of the Serpents, but handle with impunity
the cobra or the cerastes with all its venomous apparatus in
good order.</p>

<p>We now come to the second branch of the subject, namely,
the influence of sound upon the cobra and other Serpents. The
charmers are always provided with musical instruments, of
which a sort of flute with a loud shrill sound is the one which
is mostly used in the performances. Having ascertained, from
slight marks which their practised eyes easily discover, that
a Serpent is hidden in some crevice, the charmer plays upon his
flute, and in a short time the snake is sure to make its
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as it is fairly out, the man seizes it by the end of the
tail, and holds it up in the air at arm's length. In this position
it is helpless, having no leverage, and merely wriggles about in
fruitless struggles to escape. Having allowed it to exhaust its
strength by its efforts, the man lowers it into a basket, where it
is only too glad to find a refuge, and closes the lid. After a
while, he raises the lid and begins to play the flute.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="dance" id="dance"></a>
<img src="images/i_622.jpg" width="400" height="444" alt="dance" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TEACHING COBRAS TO DANCE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Serpent tries to glide out of the basket, but, as soon as it
does so, the lid is shut down again, and in a very short time the
reptile finds that escape is impossible, and, as long as it hears
the sound of the flute, only raises its head in the air, supporting
itself on the lower portion of its tail, and continues to wave its
head from side to side as long as it hears the sound of the music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span></p>

<p>The rapidity with which a cobra learns this lesson is extraordinary,
the charmers being as willing to show their mastery
over newly-caught Serpents as over those which have been
long in their possession.</p>

<p>The colour of the Cobra is in most cases a brownish olive. The
most noted peculiarity is the expansion of the neck, popularly
called the hood. This phenomenon is attributable not only to
the skin and muscles, but to the skeleton. About twenty pairs of
the ribs of the neck and fore part of the back are flat instead of
curved, and increase gradually from the head to the eleventh or
twelfth pair, from which they decrease until they are merged into
the ordinary curved ribs of the body. When the snake is excited,
it brings these ribs forward so as to spread the skin, and then displays
the oval hood to best advantage.</p>

<p>In the Cobra di Capello the back of the hood is ornamented by
two large eye-like spots, united by a curved black stripe, so formed
that the whole mark bears a singular resemblance to a pair of
spectacles.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE CERASTES, OR SHEPHIPHON OF SCRIPTURE.</h2>


<p>The word <em>shephiphon</em>, which evidently signifies some species
of snake, only occurs once in the Scriptures, but fortunately
that single passage contains an allusion to the habits of the
serpent which makes identification nearly certain. The passage
in question occurs in Gen. xlix. 17, and forms part of the
prophecy of Jacob respecting his children: "Dan shall be a
serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse's
heels, so that his rider shall fall backward."</p>

<p>Putting aside the deeper meaning of this prophecy, there
is here an evident allusion to the habits of the <span class="smcap">Cerastes</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Horned Viper</span>, a species of venomous serpent, which is
plentiful in Northern Africa, and is found also in Palestine
and Syria. It is a very conspicuous reptile, and is easily
recognised by the two horn-like projections over the eyes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
name Cerastes, or horned, has been given to it on account of
these projections.</p>

<p>This snake has a custom of lying half buried in the sand,
awaiting the approach of some animal on which it can feed.
Its usual diet consists of the jerboas and other small mammalia,
and as they are exceedingly active, while the Cerastes is slow
and sluggish, its only chance of obtaining food is to lie in wait.
It will always take advantage of any small depression, such as
the print of a camel's foot, and, as it finds many of these
depressions in the line of the caravans, it is literally "a serpent
by the way, an adder in the path."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="horned" id="horned"></a>
<img src="images/i_624.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="horned" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HORNED VIPER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>According to the accounts of travellers, the Cerastes is much
more irritable than the cobra, and is very apt to strike at any
object which may disturb it. Therefore, whenever a horseman
passes along the usual route, his steed is very likely to disturb a
Cerastes lying in the path, and to be liable to the attack of the
irritated reptile. Horses are instinctively aware of the presence
of the snake, and mostly perceive it in time to avoid its stroke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
Its small dimensions, the snake rarely exceeding two feet in
length, enable it to conceal itself in a very small hollow, and its
brownish-white colour, diversified with darker spots, causes it to
harmonize so thoroughly with the loose sand in which it lies
buried, that, even when it is pointed out, an unpractised eye
does not readily perceive it.</p>

<p>Even the cobra is scarcely so dreaded as this little snake,
whose bite is so deadly, and whose habits are such as to cause
travellers considerable risk of being bitten.</p>

<p>The head of the Viper affords a very good example of the
venomous apparatus of the poisonous serpents, and is well worthy
of description. The poison fangs or teeth lie on the sides of the
upper jaw, folded back, and almost undistinguishable until lifted
with a needle. They are singularly fine and delicate, hardly
larger than a lady's needle, and are covered almost to their tips
with a muscular envelope, through which the points just peer.</p>

<p>The poison bags or glands, and the reservoir in which the venom
is stored, are found at the back and sides of the head, and give to
the venomous serpents that peculiar width of head which is so
unfailing a characteristic.</p>

<p>On examining carefully the poison fangs, the structure by which
the venom is injected into the wound will be easily understood.
Under a magnifying glass they will be seen to be hollow, thus
affording a passage for the poison.</p>

<p>When the creature draws back its head and opens its mouth to
strike, the deadly fangs spring up with their points ready for action,
and fully charged with their poisonous distillment.</p>

<h2>THE VIPER, OR EPHEH.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Sand-Viper, or Toxicoa&mdash;Its appearance and habits&mdash;Adder's poison&mdash;The
Cockatrice, or Tsepha&mdash;The Yellow Viper&mdash;Ancient ideas concerning the Cockatrice&mdash;Power
of its venom.</p></blockquote>


<p>We now come to the species of snake which cannot be identified
with any certainty, and will first take the word <em>epheh</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Tristram believes that he has identified the Epheh of the
Old Testament with the Sand-Viper, or Toxicoa. This reptile,
though very small, and scarcely exceeding a foot in length, is a
dangerous one, but its bite is not so deadly as that of the cobra
or cerastes. It is variable in colour, and has angular white
streaks on its body, with a row of whitish spots along the back.
The top of the head is dark, and variegated with arrow-shaped
white marks.</p>

<p>The Toxicoa is very plentiful in Northern Africa, Palestine,
Syria, and the neighbouring countries, and, as it is exceedingly
active, is held in some dread by the natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span></p>

<p>Another name of a poisonous snake occurs several times in
the Old Testament. The word is <em>tsepha</em>, or <em>tsiphôni</em>, and it is
sometimes translated as Adder, and sometimes as Cockatrice. The
word is rendered as Adder in Prov. xxiii. 32, where it is said that
wine "biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder." Even
in this case, however, the word is rendered as Cockatrice in the
marginal translation.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="toxicoa" id="toxicoa"></a>
<img src="images/i_627.jpg" width="400" height="330" alt="toxicoa" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE TOXICOA. (Supposed to be the viper of Scripture.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is found three times in the Book of Isaiah. Ch. xi. 8: "The
weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den." Also,
ch. xiv. 29: "Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod
of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's
(<em>nachash</em>) nest shall come forth a cockatrice (<em>tsepha</em>), and his fruit
shall be a fiery flying serpent." The same word occurs again
in ch. lix. 5: "They hatch cockatrice' eggs." In the prophet
Jeremiah we again find the word: "For, behold, I will send
serpents, cockatrices among you, which will not be charmed, and
they shall bite you, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>Around this reptile a wonderful variety of legends have been
accumulated. The Cockatrice was said to kill by its very look,
"because the beams of the Cockatrice's eyes do corrupt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
visible spirit of a man, which visible spirit corrupted all the
other spirits coming from the brain and life of the heart, are
thereby corrupted, and so the man dyeth."</p>

<p>The subtle poison of the Cockatrice infected everything near
it, so that a man who killed a Cockatrice with a spear fell dead
himself, by reason of the poison darting up the shaft of the spear
and passing into his hand. Any living thing near which the
Cockatrice passed was instantly slain by the fiery heat of its
venom, which was exhaled not only from its mouth, but its sides.
For the old writers, whose statements are here summarized, contrived
to jumble together a number of miscellaneous facts in
natural history, and so to produce a most extraordinary series of
legends.</p>

<p>I should not have given even this limited space to such puerile
legends, but for the fact that such stories as these were fully
believed in the days when the Authorized Version of the Bible
was translated. The translators of the Bible believed most
heartily in the mysterious and baleful reptile, and, as they saw
that the Tsepha of Scripture was an exceptionally venomous
serpent, they naturally rendered it by the word Cockatrice.</p>

<h2>THE FROG.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Frog only mentioned in the Old Testament as connected with the plagues of
Egypt&mdash;The severity of this plague explained&mdash;The Frog detestable to the
Egyptians&mdash;The Edible Frog and its numbers&mdash;Description of the species.</p></blockquote>


<p>Plentiful as is the <span class="smcap">Frog</span> throughout Egypt, Palestine, and Syria,
it is very remarkable that in the whole of the canonical books
of the Old Testament the word is only mentioned thrice, and
each case in connexion with the same event.</p>

<p>In Exod. viii. we find that the second of the plagues which
visited Egypt came out of the Nile, the sacred river, in the form
of innumerable Frogs. The reader will probably remark, on
perusing the consecutive account of these plagues, that the two
first plagues were connected with that river, and that they were
foreshadowed by the transformation of Aaron's rod.</p>

<p>When Moses and Aaron appeared before Pharaoh to ask him
to let the people go, Pharaoh demanded a miracle from them, as
had been foretold. Following the divine command, Aaron threw
down his rod, which was changed into a serpent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span></p>

<p>Next, as was most appropriate, came a transformation wrought
on the river by means of the same rod which had been transformed
into a Serpent, the whole of the fresh-water throughout
the land being turned into blood, and the fish dying and polluting
the venerated river with their putrefying bodies. In Egypt, a
partially rainless country, such a calamity as this was doubly
terrible, as it at the same time desecrated the object of their
worship, and menaced them with perishing by thirst.</p>

<p>The next plague had also its origin in the river, but extended
far beyond the limits of its banks. The frogs, being unable to
return to the contaminated stream wherein they had lived, spread
themselves in all directions, so as to fulfil the words of the prediction:
"If thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all
thy borders with frogs:</p>

<p>"And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
go up and come into thine house, and into thy bed-chamber, and
upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs"
(or dough).</p>

<p>Supposing that such a plague was to come upon us at the
present day, we should consider it to be a terrible annoyance,
yet scarcely worthy of the name of plague, and certainly not to
be classed with the turning of a river into blood, with the hail
and lightning that destroyed the crops and cattle, and with the
simultaneous death of the first-born. But the Egyptians suffered
most keenly from the infliction. They were a singularly fastidious
people, and abhorred the contact of anything that they
held to be unclean. We may well realize, therefore, the effect
of a visitation of Frogs, which rendered their houses unclean by
entering them, and themselves unclean by leaping upon them;
which deprived them of rest by getting on their beds, and of
food by crawling into their ovens and upon the dough in the
kneading-troughs.</p>

<p>And, as if to make the visitation still worse, when the plague
was removed, the Frogs died in the places into which they had
intruded, so that the Egyptians were obliged to clear their houses
of the dead carcases, and to pile them up in heaps, to be dried
by the sun or eaten by birds and other scavengers of the East.</p>

<p>As to the species of Frog which thus invaded the houses of
the Egyptians, there is no doubt whatever. It can be but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Green</span>, or <span class="smcap">Edible Frog</span> (<em>Rana esculenta</em>), which is so well known
for the delicacy of its flesh. This is believed to be the only
aquatic Frog of Egypt, and therefore must be the species which
came out of the river into the houses.</p>

<p>Both in Egypt and Palestine it exists in very great numbers,
swarming in every marshy place, and inhabiting the pools in
such numbers that the water can scarcely be seen for the Frogs.
Thus the multitudes of the Frogs which invaded the Egyptians
was no matter of wonder, the only miraculous element being
that the reptiles were simultaneously directed to the houses, and
their simultaneous death when the plague was taken away.</p>

<p>Frogs are also mentioned in Rev. xvi. 13: "And I saw three
unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon,
and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the
false prophet." With the exception of this passage, which is a
purely symbolical one, there is no mention of Frogs in the New
Testament. It is rather remarkable that the Toad, which might
be thought to afford an excellent symbol for various forms of
evil, is entirely ignored, both in the Old and New Testaments.
Probably the Frogs and Toads were all classed together under
the same title.</p>

<p class="hanging">Impossibility of distinguishing the different species of Fishes&mdash;The fishermen

<p>We now come to the <span class="smcap">Fishes</span>, a class of animals which are
repeatedly mentioned both in the Old and New Testaments, but
only in general terms, no one species being described so as to
give the slightest indication of its identity.</p>

<p>This is the more remarkable because, although the Jews were,
like all Orientals, utterly unobservant of those characteristics by
which the various species are distinguished from each other, we
might expect that St. Peter and other of the fisher Apostles would
have given the names of some of the Fish which they were in
the habit of catching, and by the sale of which they gained
their living.</p>

<p>It is true that the Jews, as a nation, would not distinguish
between the various species of Fishes, except, perhaps, by comparative
size. But professional fishermen would be sure to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
one species from another, if only for the fact that they
would sell the best-flavoured Fish at the highest price.</p>

<p>We might have expected, for example, that the Apostles and
disciples who were present when the miraculous draught of Fishes
took place would have mentioned the technical names by which
they were accustomed to distinguish the different degrees of the
saleable and unsaleable kinds.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="peter" id="peter"></a>
<img src="images/i_635.jpg" width="400" height="548" alt="peter" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PETER CATCHES THE FISH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Or we might have expected that on the occasion when St. Peter
cast his line and hook into the sea, and drew out a Fish holding
the tribute-money in his mouth, we might have learned the particular
species of Fish which was thus captured. We ourselves
would assuredly have done so. It would not have been thought
sufficient merely to say that a Fish was caught with money in
its mouth, but it would have been considered necessary to mention
the particular fish as well as the particular coin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span></p>

<p>But it must be remembered that the whole tone of thought
differs in Orientals and Europeans, and that the exactness required
by the one has no place in the mind of the other. The
whole of the Scriptural narratives are essentially Oriental in
their character, bringing out the salient points in strong relief,
but entirely regardless of minute detail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We find from many passages both in the Old and New Testaments
that Fish were largely used as food by the Israelites, both
when captives in Egypt and after their arrival in the Promised
Land. Take, for example, Numb. xi. 4, 5: "And the children of
Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>

<p>"We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely."
Then, in the Old Testament, although we do not find many such
categorical statements, there are many passages which allude to
professional fishermen, showing that there was a demand for the
Fish which they caught, sufficient to yield them a maintenance.</p>

<p>In the New Testament, however, there are several passages in
which the Fishes are distinctly mentioned as articles of food.
Take, for example, the well-known miracle of multiplying the
loaves and the Fishes, and the scarcely less familiar passage in
John xxi. 9: "As soon then as they were come to land, they
saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."</p>

<p>We find in all these examples that bread and Fish were eaten
together. Indeed, Fish was eaten with bread just as we eat
cheese or butter; and St. John, in his account of the multiplication
of the loaves and Fishes, does not use the word "fish," but
another word which rather signifies sauce, and was generally
employed to designate the little Fish that were salted down and
dried in the sunbeams for future use.</p>

<p>As to the various species which were used for different purposes,
we know really nothing, the Jews merely dividing their
Fish into clean and unclean.</p>

<p>Some of the species to which the prohibition would extend
are evident enough. There are, for example, the Sheat-fishes,
which have the body naked, and which are therefore taken out
of the list of permitted Fishes. The Sheat-fishes inhabit rivers
in many parts of the world, and often grow to a very considerable
size. They may be at once recognised by their peculiar
shape, and by the long, fleshy tentacles that hang from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
mouth. The object of these tentacles is rather dubious, but as
the fish have been seen to direct them at will to various objects,
it is likely that they may answer as organs of touch.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="barbel" id="barbel"></a>
<img src="images/i_637.jpg" width="400" height="408" alt="barbel" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">1. <span class="smcap">Muræna.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <span class="smcap">Long-headed barbel.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <span class="smcap">Sheat-fish.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>As might be conjectured from its general appearance, it is one
of the Fishes that love muddy banks, in which it is fond of
burrowing so deeply that, although the river may swarm with
Sheat-fishes, a practised eye is required to see them.</p>

<p>As far as the Sheat-fishes are concerned, there is little need
for the prohibition, inasmuch as the flesh is not at all agreeable
in flavour, and is difficult of digestion, being very fat and gelatinous.
The swimming-bladder of the Sheat-fish is used in some
countries for making a kind of isinglass, similar in character to
that of the sturgeon, but of coarser quality.</p>

<p>The lowermost figure in the above illustration represents a species
which is exceedingly plentiful in the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span></p>

<p>On account of the mode in which their body is covered, the
whole of the sharks and rays are excluded from the list of permitted
Fish, as, although they have fins, they have no scales, their
place being taken by shields varying greatly in size. The same
rule excludes the whole of the lamprey tribe, although the excellence
of their flesh is well known.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Jews almost universally declare that the
Muræna and Eel tribe are also unclean, because, although it has
been proved that these Fishes really possess scales as well as
fins, and are therefore legally permissible, the scales are hidden
under a slimy covering, and are so minute as to be practically
absent.</p>

<p>The uppermost figure in the illustration represents the celebrated
Muræna, one of the fishes of the Mediterranean, in which
sea it is tolerably plentiful. In the days of the old Roman
empire, the Muræna was very highly valued for the table. The
wealthier citizens built ponds in which the Murænæ were kept
alive until they were wanted. This Fish sometimes reaches four
feet in length.</p>

<p>The rest of the Fishes which are shown in the three illustrations
belong to the class of clean Fish, and were permitted as
food. The figure of the Fish between the Muræna and Sheat-fish
is the Long-headed Barbel, so called from its curious form.</p>

<p>The Barbels are closely allied to the carps, and are easily
known by the barbs or beards which hang from their lips.
Like the sheat-fishes, the Barbels are fond of grubbing in the mud,
for the purpose of getting at the worms, grubs, and larvæ of
aquatic insects that are always to be found in such places. The
Barbels are rather long in proportion to their depth, a peculiarity
which, owing to the length of the head, is rather exaggerated in
this species.</p>

<p>The Long-headed Barbel is extremely common in Palestine, and
may be taken with the very simplest kind of net. Indeed, in
some places, the fish are so numerous that a common sack
answers nearly as well as a net.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the ancient Romans were in the
habit of forming ponds in which the Murænæ were kept, and it is
evident, from several passages of Scripture, that the Jews were
accustomed to preserve fish in a similar manner, though they
would not restrict their tanks or ponds to one species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span></p>

<p>The accompanying illustration represents Fishes of the Mediterranean
Sea, and it is probable that one of them may be
identified, though the passage in which it is mentioned is only
an inferential one. In the prophecy against Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, the prophet Ezekiel writes as follows: "I will put hooks
in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto
thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy
rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales"
(xxix. 4).</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="sucking" id="sucking"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FISHES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.<br />

1. <span class="smcap">Sucking-fish.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <span class="smcap">Tunny.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <span class="smcap">Coryphene.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Some believe that the prophet made allusion to the Sucking-fish,
which has the dorsal fins developed into a most curious
apparatus of adhesion, by means of which it can fasten itself at
will to any smooth object, and hold so tightly to it that it can
scarcely be torn away without injury.</p>

<p>The common Sucking-fish is shown in the upper part of the
illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, however, other fish which have powers of adhesion
which, although not so remarkable as those of the Sucking-fish,
are yet very strong. There is, for example, the well-known
Lump-sucker, or Lump-fish, which has the ventral fins modified
into a sucker so powerful that, when one of these fishes has
been put into a pail of water, it has attached itself so firmly to
the bottom of the vessel that when lifted by the tail it raised
the pail, together with several gallons of water.</p>

<p>The Gobies, again, have their ventral fins united and modified
into a single sucker, by means of which the fish is able to secure
itself to a stone, rock, or indeed any tolerably smooth surface.
These fishes are popularly known as Bull-routs.</p>

<p>The centre of the illustration is occupied by another of the
Mediterranean fishes. This is the well-known Tunny, which furnishes
food to the inhabitants of the coasts of this inland sea, and
indeed constitutes one of their principal sources of wealth. This
fine fish is on an average four or five feet in length, and sometimes
attains the length of six or seven feet.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Tunny is excellent, and the fish is so conspicuous,
that the silence of the Scriptures concerning its existence
shows the utter indifference to specific accuracy that prevailed
among the various writers.</p>

<p>The other figure represents the Coryphene, popularly, though
very wrongly, called the Dolphin, and celebrated, under that
name, for the beautiful colours which fly over the surface of the
body as it dies.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Coryphene is excellent, and in the times of
classic Rome the epicures were accustomed to keep these fish
alive, and at the beginning of a feast to lay them before the
guests, so that they might, in the first place, witness the magnificent
colours of the dying fish, and, in the second place, might
be assured that when it was cooked it was perfectly fresh. Even
during life, the Coryphene is a most lovely fish, and those who
have witnessed it playing round a ship, or dashing off in chase
of a shoal of flying-fishes, can scarcely find words to express
their admiration of its beauty.</p>

<h2>FISHES.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Various modes of capturing Fish&mdash;The hook and line&mdash;Military use of the hook&mdash;Putting
a hook in the jaws&mdash;The fishing spear&mdash;Different kinds of net&mdash;The
casting-net&mdash;Prevalence of this form&mdash;Technical words among fishermen&mdash;Fishing

Siam&mdash;Various Fishes of Egypt and Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>As to the various methods of capturing Fish, we will first take
the simplest plan, that of the hook and line.</p>

<p>Sundry references are made to angling, both in the Old and
New Testaments. See, for example, the well-known passage
respecting the leviathan, in Job xli. 1, 2: "Canst thou draw
out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which
thou lettest down?</p>

<p>"Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
with a thorn?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thought that the last clause of this passage refers, not to
the actual capture of the Fish, but to the mode in which they
were kept in the tanks, each being secured by a ring or hook
and line, so that it might be taken when wanted.</p>

<p>On referring to the New Testament, we find that the fisher
Apostles used both the hook and the net. See Matt. xvii. 27:
"Go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish
that first cometh up." Now this passage explains one or two
points.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is one among others which shows that,
although the Apostles gave up all to follow Christ, they did not
throw away their means of livelihood, as some seem to fancy,
nor exist ever afterwards on the earnings of others. On the
contrary, they retained their fisher equipment, whether boats,
nets, or hooks; and here we find St. Peter, after the way of
fishermen, carrying about with him the more portable implements
of his craft.</p>

<p>Next, the phrase "casting" the hook into the sea is exactly
expressive of the mode in which angling is conducted in the sea
and large pieces of water, such as the Lake of Galilee. The
fisherman does not require a rod, but takes his line, which has
a weight just above the hook, coils it on his left arm in lasso
fashion, baits the hook, and then, with a peculiar swing, throws
it into the water as far as it will reach. The hook is allowed to
sink for a short time, and is then drawn towards the shore in
a series of jerks, in order to attract the Fish, so that, although the
fisherman does not employ a rod, he manages his line very much
as does an angler of our own day when "spinning" for pike
or trout.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fisherman has a number of lines to manage,
and in this case he acts in a slightly different manner. After
throwing out the loaded hook, as above mentioned, he takes a
short stick, notched at one end, and pointed at the other, thrusts
the sharp end into the ground at the margin of the water, and
hitches the line on the notch.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to do the same with all his lines in succession,
and when he has flung the last hook into the water, he
sits down on a heap of leaves and grass which he has gathered
together, and watches the lines to see if either of them is moved
in the peculiar jerking manner which is characteristic of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
"bite." After a while, he hauls them in successively, removes
the Fish that may have been caught, and throws the lines into
the water afresh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to the practice of catching Fish by the net, a
custom to which the various Scriptural writers frequently refer,
sometimes in course of historical narrative, and sometimes by
way of allegory or metaphor. The reader will remember that
the net was also used on land for the purpose of catching wild
animals, and that many of the allusions to the net which occur
in the Old Testament refer to the land and not to the water.</p>

<p>The commonest kind of net, which was used in the olden
times as it is now, was the casting-net. This kind of net is
circular, and is loaded all round its edge with weights, and suspended
by the middle to a cord. When the fisherman throws
this net, he gathers it up in folds in his arms, and, with a peculiar
swing of the arms, only to be learned by long practice,
flings it so that it spreads out and falls in its circular form upon
the surface of the water. It rapidly sinks to the bottom, the
loaded circumference causing it to assume a cup-like form,
enclosing within its meshes all the Fish that happen to be
under it as it falls. When it has reached the bottom, the
fisherman cautiously hauls in the rope, so that the loaded edges
gradually approach each other, and by their own weight cling
together and prevent the Fish from escaping as the net is slowly
drawn ashore.</p>

<p>This kind of net is found, with certain modifications, in
nearly all parts of the world. The Chinese are perhaps supreme
in their management of it. They have a net of extraordinary
size, and cast it by flinging it over their backs, the huge circle
spreading itself out in the most perfect manner as it falls on the
water.</p>

<p>At the present day, when the fishermen use this net they
wade into the sea as far as they can, and then cast it. In
consequence of this custom, the fishermen are always naked
while engaged in their work, wearing nothing but a thick cap in
order to save themselves from sun-stroke. It is probable that
on the memorable occasion mentioned by St. John, in chap. xxi.,
all the fishermen were absolutely, and not relatively naked, wearing
no clothes at all, not even the ordinary tunic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span></p>

<p>That a great variety of nets was used by the ancient Jews is
evident from the fact that there are no less than ten words to
signify different kinds of net. At the present day we have
very great difficulty in deciding upon the exact interpretation
of these technical terms, especially as in very few cases are
we assisted either by the context or by the etymology of the
words. It is the same in all trades or pursuits, and we can
easily understand how our own names of drag-net, seine, trawl,
and keer-drag would perplex any commentator who happened
to live some two thousand years after English had ceased to be
a living language.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="dragging" id="dragging"></a>
<img src="images/i_644.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="dragging" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MODE OF DRAGGING THE SEINE-NET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Sagene, or seine-net, was made in lengths, any number of
which could be joined together, so as to enclose a large space of
water. The upper edge was kept at the surface of the water by
floats, and the lower edge sunk by weights.</p>

<p>This net was always taken to sea in vessels, and when
"shot" the various lengths were joined together, and the net
extended in a line, with a boat at each end. The boats then
gradually approached each other, so as to bring the net into a
semicircle, and finally met, enclosing thereby a vast number of
Fishes in their meshen walls. The water was then beaten, so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
to frighten the Fishes and drive them into the meshes, and the
net was then either taken ashore, or lifted by degrees on board
the boats, and the Fish removed from it.</p>

<p>As in a net of this kind Fishes of all sorts are enclosed, the
contents are carefully examined, and those which are unfit for
eating are thrown away. Even at the present day much care is
taken in the selection, but in the ancient times the fishermen
were still more cautious, every Fish having to be separately
examined in order that the presence both of fins and scales
might be assured before the captors could send it to the market.</p>

<p>It is to this custom that Christ alludes in the well-known
parable of the net: "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto
a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind;</p>

<p>"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down,
and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lastly, we come to the religious, or rather superstitious,
part played by Fish in the ancient times. That the Egyptians
employed Fish as material symbols of Divine attributes we learn
from secular writers, such as Herodotus and Strabo.</p>

<p>The Jews, who seem to have had an irrepressible tendency to
idolatry, and to have adopted the idols of every people with
whom they came in contact, resuscitated the Fish-worship of
Egypt as soon as they found themselves among the Philistines.
We might naturally imagine that as the Israelites were bitterly
opposed to their persistent enemy, who trod them under foot
and crushed every attempt at rebellion for more than three
hundred years, they would repudiate the worship as well as the
rule of their conquerors. But, on the contrary, they adopted the
worship of Dagon, the Fish-god, who was the principal deity
of the Philistines, and erected temples in his honour.</p>

<p>We find precisely the same worship at the present day in
Siam, where Dagon has exactly the same form as among the
Philistines of old. There is now before me a photograph of
a great temple at Ayutia, the entrance to which is guarded by
two huge images of the Fish-god. They are about sixty feet in
height, and have both legs and feet like man, but in addition
the lower part of the body is modified into the tail of a Fish,
which, in common with the whole of the body, is covered with
gilded scales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that the reader may see examples of the typical Fish
which are to be found in Egypt and Palestine, I have added
three more species, which are represented in the following illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="perch" id="perch"></a>

</div>

<p>The uppermost figure represents the <span class="smcap">Nile Perch</span>. This Fish is
plentiful in the Nile, and in the mouths of many Asiatic rivers.
It is brown above, silvery white below, and may be distinguished
by the armed gill-covers, and the three strong spines of the anal
fin. The tongue is smooth.</p>

<p>Immediately below the Nile Perch is the <span class="smcap">Star-gazer</span>.</p>

<p>This Fish is found in the Mediterranean, and derives its name
from the singular mode in which the eyes are set in the head,
so that it looks upwards instead of sideways. It is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
mud-lovers, a fact which accounts for the peculiar position of
the eyes. It is said to feed after the fashion of the fishing-frog&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
by burying itself in the mud and attracting other Fishes
by a worm-like appendage of its mouth, and pouncing on them
before they are aware of their danger.</p>

<p>This is not a pretty Fish, and as it is very spiny, is not
pleasant to the grasp, but its flesh is very good, and it is much
valued by those who can obtain it.</p>

<p>The last Fish to be noticed is the <span class="smcap">Surmullet</span>, a Fish that is
equally remarkable for the beauty of its colours and the excellence
of its flesh.</p>

<p>Leaving the higher forms of animal life, we now pass to the
Invertebrated Animals which are mentioned in Scripture.</p>

<p>As may be inferred from the extreme looseness of nomenclature
which prevails among the higher animals, the species
which can be identified are comparatively few, and of them but
a very few details are given in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Taking them in their zoological order, we will begin with the
<span class="smcap">Molluscs</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are all familiar with the value which was set by the
ancients upon the peculiar dye which may be called by the
name of Imperial Purple. In the first place, it was exceedingly
costly, not only for its richness of hue, but from the great
difficulty with which a sufficient quantity could be procured for
staining a dress. Purple was exclusively a royal colour, which
might not be worn by a subject. Among the ancient Romans,
during the times of the Cæsars, any one who ventured to appear
in a dress of purple would do so at the peril of his life. In
the consular days of Rome, the dress of the consuls was white,
striped with purple; but the Cæsars advanced another step in
luxury, and dyed the whole toga of this costly hue.</p>

<p>The colour of the dye is scarcely what we understand by the
term "purple," <em>i.e.</em> a mixture of blue and red. It has but very
little blue in it, and has been compared by the ancients to
the colour of newly-clotted blood. It is obtained from several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
Shell Fish belonging to the great Whelk family, the chief of
which is the <em>Murex brandaris</em>.</p>

<p>The shell is shaped something like that of a whelk, but is
very smooth and porcelain-like, and is generally white, ornamented
with several coloured bands. It is, however, one of the
most variable of shells, differing not only in colour but in form.
It always inhabits the belt of the shore between tide-marks, and
preys upon other Molluscs, such as the mussel and periwinkle,
literally licking them to pieces with its long riband tongue.</p>

<p>This tongue is beset with rows of hooked teeth, exactly like
the shark-tooth weapons of the Samoan and Mangaian Islanders,
and with it the creature is enabled to bore through the shells of
mussels and similar Molluscs, and to eat the enclosed animal.
It is very destructive to periwinkles, thrusting its tongue through
the mouth of the shell, piercing easily the operculum by which
the entrance is closed, and gradually scooping out the unfortunate
inmate.</p>

<p>Even the bivalves, which can shut themselves up between
two shells, fare no better, the tongue of the Dog-Whelk rasping
a hole in the hard shell in eight-and-forty hours.</p>

<p>In order to procure the animal, the shell must be broken with
a sharp blow of a small hammer, and the receptacle of the
colouring matter can then be seen behind the head, and recognised
by its lighter hue.</p>

<p>When it is opened, a creamy sort of matter exudes. It is
yellowish, and gives no promise of its future richness of hue.
There is only one drop of this matter in each animal, and it is
about sufficient in quantity to stain a piece of linen the size of a
dime.</p>

<p>The best mode of seeing the full beauty of the purple is to
take a number of the Molluscs, and to stain as large a surface as
possible. The piece of linen should then be exposed to the rays
of the sun, when it will go through a most curious series of
colours. The yellow begins to turn green, and, after a while, the
stained portions of the linen will be entirely green, the yellow
having been vanquished by the blue. By degrees the blue predominates
more and more over the yellow, until the linen is no
more green, but blue. Then, just as the yellow yielded to the
blue, the blue yields to red, and becomes first violet, then purple,
and lastly assumes the blood-red hue of royalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span></p>

<p>The colour is very permanent, and, instead of fading by time,
seems rather to brighten.</p>

<p>In some cases the ancients appear not to have troubled themselves
with the complicated operation of taking the animal out
of the shell, opening the receptacle, and squeezing the contents
on the fabric to be dyed, but simply crushed the whole of the
Mollusc, so as to set the colouring matter free, and steeped the
cloth in the pulp. Tyre was one of the most celebrated spots
for this manufacture, the "Tyrian dye" being celebrated for its
richness. Heaps of broken shells remain to the present day as
memorials of the long-perished manufacture.</p>

<p>The value which the ancients set upon this dye is shown by
many passages in various books. Among others we may refer
to Herodotus.</p>

<p>Cambyses, it appears, had a design to make war upon three
nations, the Ammonians, the Carthaginians, and the Ethiopians.
He determined to invade the first by land, and the second by
sea; but, being ignorant of the best method of reaching the Ethiopians,
he dispatched messengers to them, nominally as ambassadors,
but practically as spies. He sent to the King of Ethiopia
valuable presents&mdash;namely, a purple mantle, a golden necklace
and bracelet, an elaborate box of perfumed ointment, and a
cask of palm-wine, these evidently being considered a proof of
imperial magnificence.</p>

<p>The Ethiopian king ridiculed the jewels, praised the wine,
and asked curiously concerning the dye with which the purple
mantle was stained. On being told the mode of preparation, he
refused to believe the visitors, and, referring to the changing
hues of the mantle and to the perfume of the ointment, he
showed his appreciation of their real character by saying that
the goods were deceptive, and so were the bearers.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">argaman</i>, which signifies the regal purple,
occurs several times in Scripture, and takes a slightly different
form according to the Chaldaic or Hebraic idiom.</p>

<p>For example, we find it in Exod. xxv. 4: "This is the offering
which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass,</p>

<p>"And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It occurs again in 2 Chron. ii. 7: "Send me now therefore a
man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in
iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue."</p>

<h2>THE SNAIL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Snail which melteth&mdash;Rendering of the Jewish Bible&mdash;Theory respecting the
track of the Snail&mdash;The Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Shablul</i>&mdash;Various Snails of Palestine.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is a very remarkable and not very intelligible passage
in Ps. lviii. 8: "As a snail which melteth, let every one of them
pass away." The Jewish Bible renders the passage in a way
which explains the idea which evidently prevailed at the time
when the Psalms were composed: "As a snail let him melt as
he passeth on."</p>

<p>The ancients had an idea that the slimy track made by a
Snail as it crawled along was subtracted from the substance of
its body, and that in consequence the farther it crept, the smaller
it became, until at last it wasted entirely away. The commentators
on the Talmud took this view of the case. The
Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">shablul</i>, which undoubtedly does signify a Snail
of some kind, is thus explained: "The Shablul is a creeping
thing: when it comes out of its shell, saliva pours from itself,
until it becomes liquid, and so dies."</p>

<p>Other explanations of this passage have been offered, but
there is no doubt that the view taken by these commentators is
the correct one, and that the Psalmist, when he wrote the
terrible series of denunciations in which the passage in question
occurs, had in his mind the popular belief regarding the gradual
wasting away of the Snail as it "passeth on."</p>

<p>It is needless to say that no particular species of Snail is
mentioned, and almost as needless to state that in Palestine
there are many species of Snails, to any or all of which these
words are equally applicable.</p>

<h2>THE PEARL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Pearl of Scripture&mdash;Wisdom compared to Pearl&mdash;Metaphorical uses of the
Pearl&mdash;The Pearl of great price&mdash;Casting Pearls before swine.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is only one passage in the Old Testament in which can
be found the word which is translated as <span class="smcap">Pearl</span>, and it is certain
that the word in question may have another interpretation.</p>

<p>The word in question is <em>gabish</em>, and occurs in Job xxviii. 18.
Treating of wisdom, in that magnificent passage beginning, "But
where shall Wisdom be found, and where is the place of understanding?"
the sacred writer uses these words, "No mention
shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is
above rubies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p>In consequence of the labour and research required for seeking
wisdom, it was proverbially likened to a Pearl, and in this sense
we must understand the warning of our Lord, not to cast Pearls
before swine. The "pearl of great price" is another form of the
same metaphor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The substance of Pearls is essentially the same as that which
lines many shells, and is known as "mother of pearl."</p>

<p>Although a large number of shell-fish secrete "mother of pearl,"
only a few of them yield true Pearls. The finest are obtained
from the so-called Pearl oyster, an illustration of which is given
on the preceding page.</p>

<p>The Ancients obtained their Pearls chiefly from India and the
Persian Gulf, where to this day the industry of Pearl-fishing is
still carried on by the natives.</p>

<p>The oysters containing the Pearls are brought up from the
bottom of the sea by divers, who go out in boats to the fishing-grounds,
which are some distance from the shore.</p>

<p>Leaping naked into the water, carrying a heavy stone to enable
him to sink quickly to the bottom, the diver descends to where the
oysters lie, and secures as many of them as possible during the
limited time that his breath lasts. On an average the divers
remain under water from fifty to eighty seconds, though some
can endure a much longer period.</p>

<p>Sharks are the special dread of Pearl-divers, and many are
carried off by this fierce monster of the deep. To arm himself
against their attack the diver carries a sharp knife, and instances
are known of his having attacked and fairly defeated the dread
destroyer in its own element.</p>

<p>Not only is the diver exposed to the danger of attack from
sharks, but his hazardous calling is necessarily exhausting, and,
as a rule, he is a short-lived man.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of fresh-water mussels which contain
Pearls of an inferior quality; perhaps the most celebrated of
these is the Pearl Mussel of the Chinese, who make a singular
use of it. They string a number of globular pellets, and introduce
them between the valves of the mussel, so that in course
of time the creature deposits a coating of pearly substance upon
them, and forms a very good imitation of real Pearls.</p>

<h2>INSECTS.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE LOCUST.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Insects&mdash;The Locust-The two migratory Locusts at rest and on the wing&mdash;The
Locust swarms&mdash;Gordon Cumming's account&mdash;Progress of the insect hosts&mdash;Vain
attempts to check them&mdash;Tossed up and down as a Locust&mdash;Effect of the
winds on the insect&mdash;The east and the west winds&mdash;Locusts used for food&mdash;Ancient
and modern travellers&mdash;The food of John the Baptist.</p></blockquote>


<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Locusts</span> there are several species in Palestine, two of
which are represented in the accompanying plate. Those on the
ground are the common Migratory Locusts, while those on the
wing, which have long heads, are a species of <em>Truxalis</em>.</p>

<p>The Locust belongs to the great order of Orthoptera, or
straight-winged insects. They have, when fully developed,
four wings, the two front being thick and membraneous, while
the two hinder wings are large, delicate, translucent, and
folded longitudinally under the front pair of wings when the
insect is at rest. In the Locusts these characteristics are
admirably shown. The appearance of a Locust when at rest
and when flying is so different that the creature is at first
sight scarcely recognisable as the same creature. When at
rest, it is a compact and tolerably stout insect, with a dull
though delicately coloured body; but when it takes flight it
appears to attain twice its previous dimensions.</p>

<p>The front pair of wings, which alone were seen before they
were expanded, became comparatively insignificant, while the
hinder pair, which were before invisible, became the most prominent
part of the insect, their translucent folds being coloured
with the most brilliant hues, according to the species. The body
seems to have shrunk as the wings have increased, and to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
diminished to half its previous size, while the long legs that previously
were so conspicuous are stretched out like the legs of a
flying heron.</p>

<p>All the Locusts are vegetable-feeders, and do great harm
wherever they happen to be plentiful, their powerful jaws
severing even the thick grass stems as if cut by scissors. But it
is only when they invade a country that their real power is felt.
They come flying with the wind in such vast multitudes that
the sky is darkened as if by thunder-clouds; and when they
settle, every vestige of green disappears off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon Cumming once saw a flight of these Locusts.
They flew about three hundred feet from the ground, and came
on in thick, solid masses, forming one unbroken cloud. On all
sides nothing was to be seen but Locusts. The air was full of
them, and the plain was covered with them, and for more than
an hour the insect army flew past him. When the Locusts settle,
they eat with such voracity that the sound caused by their jaws
cutting the leaves and grass can be heard at a great distance;
and even the young Locusts, which have no wings, and are
graphically termed by the Dutch colonists of Southern Africa
"voet-gangers," or foot-goers, are little inferior in power of jaw
to the fully-developed insect.</p>

<p>As long as they have a favourable wind, nothing stops the
progress of the Locusts. They press forward just like the vast
herds of antelopes that cover the plains of Africa, or the bisons that
once blackened the prairies of America, and the progress of even
the wingless young is as irresistible as that of the adult insects.
Regiments of soldiers have in vain attempted to stop them.
Trenches have been dug across their path, only to be filled up
in a few minutes with the advancing hosts, over whose bodies
the millions of survivors continued their march. When the
trenches were filled with water, the result was the same; and
even when fire was substituted for water, the flames were
quenched by the masses of Locusts that fell into them. When
they come to a tree, they climb up it in swarms, and devour
every particle of foliage, not even sparing the bark of the smaller
branches. They ascend the walls of houses that come in the
line of their march, swarming in at the windows, and gnawing
in their hunger the very woodwork of the furniture.</p>

<p>We shall now see how true to nature is the terrible prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a><br /><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
of Joel. "A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds
and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains:
a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
generations.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 332px;"><a name="swarm" id="swarm"></a>
<img src="images/i_658.jpg" width="332" height="600" alt="swarm" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">LOCUSTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame
burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and
behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall
escape them.</p>

<p>"And the Lord shall utter His voice before His army: for His
camp is very great" (Joel ii. 2-11).</p>

<p>Nothing can be more vividly accurate than this splendid
description of the Locust armies. First we have the darkness
caused by them as they fly like black clouds between the sun
and the earth. Then comes the contrast between the blooming
and fertile aspect of the land before they settle on it, and its
utter desolation when they leave it.</p>

<p>There is one passage in the Scriptures which at first sight
seems rather obscure, but is clear enough when we understand
the character of the insect to which it refers: "I am gone like
the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the
locust" (Ps. cix. 23).</p>

<p>Although the Locusts have sufficient strength of flight to
remain on the wing for a considerable period, and to pass over
great distances, they have little or no command over the direction
of their flight, and always travel with the wind, just as has
been mentioned regarding the quail. So entirely are they at the
mercy of the wind, that if a sudden gust arises the Locusts are
tossed about in the most helpless manner; and if they should
happen to come across one of the circular air-currents that are
so frequently found in the countries which they inhabit, they are
whirled round and round without the least power of extricating
themselves.</p>

<p>In the account of the great plague of Locusts, the wind is
mentioned as the proximate cause both of their arrival and their
departure. See, for example, Exod. x. 12, 13:</p>

<p>"And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over
the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon
the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
the hail hath left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,
and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day,
and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind
brought the locusts."</p>

<p>Afterwards, when Moses was brought before Pharaoh, and
entreated to remove the plague which had been brought upon
the land, the west wind was employed to take the Locusts away,
just as the east wind had brought them.</p>

<p>"He went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord.</p>

<p>"And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took
away the locusts, and cast them into the Red Sea; there remained
not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt" (Exod. x. 18, 19).</p>

<p>Modern travellers have given accounts of these Locust armies,
which exactly correspond with the sacred narrative. One traveller
mentions that, after a severe storm, the Locusts were
destroyed in such multitudes, that they were heaped in a sort
of wall, varying from three to four feet in height, fifty miles in
length, and almost unapproachable, on account of the odour of
their decomposing bodies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to the use of Locusts as food.</p>

<p>Very few insects have been recognised as fit for human food,
even among uncivilized nations, and it is rather singular that
the Israelites, whose dietary was so scrupulously limited, should
have been permitted the use of the Locust. These insects are,
however, eaten in all parts of the world which they frequent,
and in some places form an important article of diet, thus
compensating in some way for the amount of vegetable food
which they consume.</p>

<p>When their captors have roasted and eaten as many as they
can manage to devour, they dry the rest over the fires, pulverize
them between two stones, and keep the meal for future use,
mixing it with water, or, if they can get it, with milk.</p>

<p>We will now take a few accounts given by travellers of the
present day, selecting one or two from many. Mr. W. G. Palgrave,
in his "Central and Eastern Arabia," gives a description
of the custom of eating Locusts. "On a sloping bank, at a
short distance in front, we discerned certain large black patches,
in strong contrast with the white glisten of the soil around, and
at the same time our attention was attracted by a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
whizzing, like that of a flight of hornets, close along the ground,
while our dromedaries capered and started as though struck
with sudden insanity.</p>

<p>"The cause of all this was a vast swarm of locusts, here
alighted in their northerly wanderings from their birthplace in
the Dahna; their camp extended far and wide, and we had
already disturbed their outposts. These insects are wont to
settle on the ground after sunset, and there, half-stupified by
the night chill, await the morning rays, which warm them once
more into life and movement.</p>

<p>"This time, the dromedaries did the work of the sun, and it
would be hard to say which of the two were the most frightened,
they or the locusts. It was truly laughable to see so huge a
beast lose his wits for fear at the flight of a harmless, stingless
insect, for, of all timid creatures, none equal this 'ship of the
desert' for cowardice.</p>

<p>"But, if the beasts were frightened, not so their masters.
I really thought they would have gone mad for joy. Locusts
are here an article of food, nay, a dainty, and a good swarm of
them is begged of Heaven in Arabia....</p>

<p>"The locust, when boiled or fried, is said to be delicious, and
boiled and fried accordingly they are to an incredible extent.
However, I never could persuade myself to taste them, whatever
invitations the inhabitants of the land, smacking their lips
over large dishes full of entomological 'delicatesses,' would make
me to join them. Barakàt ventured on one for a trial. He
pronounced it oily and disgusting, nor added a second to the
first: it is caviare to unaccustomed palates.</p>

<p>"The swarm now before us was a thorough godsend for our
Arabs, on no account to be neglected. Thirst, weariness, all
were forgotten, and down the riders leaped from their starting
camels. This one spread out a cloak, that one a saddle-bag, a
third his shirt, over the unlucky creatures, destined for the
morning meal. Some flew away, whizzing across our feet;
others were caught, and tied up in sacks."</p>

<p>Mr. Mansfield Parkyns, in his "Life in Abyssinia," mentions
that the true Abyssinian will not eat the Locust, but that the
negroes and Arabs do so. He describes the flavour as being
something between the burnt end of a quill and a crumb of
linseed cake. The flavour, however, depends much on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
mode of cooking, and, as some say, on the nature of the Locusts'
food.</p>

<p>Signor Pierotti states, in his "Customs and Traditions of
Palestine," that Locusts are really excellent food, and that he
was accustomed to eat them, not from necessity, but from choice,
and compares their flavour to that of shrimps.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingstone makes a similar comparison. In Palestine,
Locusts are eaten either roasted or boiled in salt and water, but,
when preserved for future use, they are dried in the sun, their
heads, wings, and legs picked off, and their bodies ground into
dust. This dust has naturally a rather bitter flavour, which is
corrected by mixing it with camel's milk or honey, the latter
being the favourite substance.</p>

<p>We may now see that the food of John the Baptist was, like his
dress, that of a people who lived at a distance from towns, and
that there was no more hardship in the one than in the other.
Some commentators have tried to prove that he fed on the fruit
of the locust or carob tree&mdash;the same that is used in some
countries for feeding cattle; but there is not the least ground for
such an explanation. The account of his life, indeed, requires
no explanation; Locust-dust, mixed with honey, being an ordinary
article of food even at the present day.</p>

<h2>THE BEE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Honey Bee of Palestine&mdash;Abundance of Bees in the
Holy Land&mdash;Habitations of the wild Bee&mdash;The honey of
Scripture&mdash;Domesticated Bees and their hives&mdash;Stores of wild
honey&mdash;The story of Jonathan&mdash;The Crusaders and the honey.</p></blockquote>


<p>Fortunately, there is no doubt about the rendering of the
Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">debôrah,</i> which has always been acknowledged
to be rightly translated as "Bee."</p>

<p>The Honey Bee is exceedingly plentiful in Palestine, and in
some parts of the country multiplying to such an extent that
the precipitous ravines in which it takes up its residence are
almost impassable by human beings, so jealous are the Bees of
their domains. Although the Bee is not exactly the same
species as that of our own country, being the Banded Bee
<em>(Apis fasciata),</em> and not the <em>Apis mellifica,</em> the two insects very
much resemble each other in shape, colour, and habits. Both of
them share the instinctive dislike of strangers and jealousy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
intrusion, and the Banded Bee of Palestine has as great an
objection to intrusion as its congener in this country.</p>

<p>Several allusions are made in the Scriptures to this trait in
the character of the Bee. See, for example, Deut. i. 44: "And
the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir,
even unto Hormah." All those who have had the misfortune
to offend Bees will recognise the truth of this metaphor, the
Amorites swarming out of the mountain like wild Bees out
of the rocky clefts which serve them as hives, and chasing the
intruder fairly out of their domains.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BEE</p></div>

<p>A similar metaphor is employed in the Psalms: "They compassed
me about; yea, they compassed me about; but in the
name of the Lord I will destroy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span></p>

<p>"They compassed me about like bees, they are quick as
the fire of thorns, but in the name of the Lord I will destroy
them."</p>

<p>The custom of swarming is mentioned in one of the earlier
books of Scripture. The reader will remember that, after
Samson had killed the lion which met him on the way, he
left the carcase alone. The various carnivorous beasts and birds
at once discover such a banquet, and in a very short time the
body of a dead animal is reduced to a hollow skeleton, partially
or entirely covered with skin, the rays of the sun drying and
hardening the skin until it is like horn.</p>

<p>In exceptionally hot weather, the same result occurs even in
this country. Some years before this account was written there
was a very hot and dry summer, and a great mortality took
place among the sheep. So many indeed died that at last
their owners merely flayed them, and left their bodies to perish.
One of the dead sheep had been thrown into a rather thick
copse, and had fallen in a spot where it was sheltered from the
wind, and yet exposed to the fierce heat of the summer's sun.
The consequence was that in a few days it was reduced to a
mere shell. The heat hardened and dried the external layer of
flesh so that not even the carnivorous beetles could penetrate it,
while the whole of the interior dissolved into a semi-putrescent
state, and was rapidly devoured by myriads of blue-bottles and
other larvæ.</p>

<p>It was so thoroughly dried that scarcely any evil odour clung
to it, and as soon as I came across it the story of Samson
received a simple elucidation. In the hotter Eastern lands, the
whole process would have been more rapid and more complete,
and the skeleton of the lion, with the hard and horny
skin strained over it, would afford exactly the habitation of
which a wandering swarm of Bees would take advantage. At
the present day swarms of wild Bees often make their habitations
within the desiccated bodies of dead camels that have
perished on the way.</p>

<p>As to the expression "hissing" for the Bee, the reader must
bear in mind that a sharp, short hiss is the ordinary call in
Palestine, when one person desires to attract the attention of
another. A similar sound, which may perhaps be expressed by
the letters <em>tst</em>, prevails on the Continent at the present day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
Signor Pierotti remarks that the inhabitants of Palestine are
even now accustomed to summon Bees by a sort of hissing
sound.</p>

<p>Whether the honey spoken of in the Scriptures was obtained
from wild or domesticated Bees is not very certain, but, as the
manners of the East are much the same now as they were three
thousand years ago, it is probable that Bees were kept then
as they are now. The hives are not in the least like ours,
but are cylindrical vases of coarse earthenware, laid horizontally,
much like the bark hives employed in many parts of Southern
Africa.</p>

<p>In some places the hives are actually built into the walls
of the houses, the closed end of the cylinder projecting into the
interior, while an entrance is made for the Bees in the other end,
so that the insects have no business in the house. When the
inhabitants wish to take the honey, they resort to the operation
which is technically termed "driving" by bee-masters.</p>

<p>They gently tap the end within the house, and continue the
tapping until the Bees, annoyed by the sound, have left the hive.
They then take out the circular door that closes the end of the
hive, remove as much comb as they want, carefully put back
those portions which contain grubs and bee-bread, and replace
the door, when the Bees soon return and fill up the gaps in
the combs. As to the wasteful, cruel, and foolish custom of
"burning" the Bees, the Orientals never think of practising it.</p>

<p>In many places the culture of Bees is carried out to a very
great extent, numbers of the earthenware cylinders being piled
on one another, and a quantity of mud thrown over them in
order to defend them from the rays of the sun, which would
soon melt the wax of the combs.</p>

<p>In consequence of the geographical characteristics of the Holy
Land, which supplies not only convenient receptacles for the Bees
in the rocks, but abundance of thyme and similar plants, vast
stores of bee-comb are to be found in the cliffs, and form no
small part of the wealth of the people.</p>

<p>The abundance of wild honey is shown by the memorable
events recorded in 1 Sam. xiv. Saul had prohibited all the
people from eating until the evening. Jonathan, who had not
heard the prohibition, was faint and weary, and, seeing honey
dripping on the ground from the abundance and weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
the comb, he took it up on the end of his staff, and ate sufficient
to restore his strength.</p>

<p>Thus, if we refer again to the history of John the Baptist
and his food, we shall find that he was in no danger of starving
for want of nourishment, the Bees breeding abundantly in the
desert places he frequented, and affording him a plentiful supply
of the very material which was needed to correct the deficiencies
of the dried locusts which he used instead of bread.</p>

<p>The expression "a land flowing with milk and honey" has
become proverbial as a metaphor expressive of plenty. Those to
whom the words were spoken understood it as something more
than a metaphor. In the work to which reference has already
been made Signor Pierotti writes as follows:&mdash;"Let us now see
how far the land could be said to flow with milk and honey
during the latter part of its history and at the present day.</p>

<p>"We find that honey was abundant in the time of the
Crusades, for the English, who followed Edward I. to Palestine,
died in great numbers from the excessive heat, and from eating
too much fruit and honey.</p>

<p>"At the present day, after traversing the country in every
direction, I am able to affirm that in the south-east and north-east,
where the ancient customs of the patriarchs are most fully
preserved, and the effects of civilization have been felt least,
milk and honey may still be said to flow, as they form a portion
of every meal, and may even be more abundant than water,
which fails occasionally in the heat of summer.... I have often
eaten of the comb, which I found very good and of delicious
fragrance."</p>

<p>The Bee represented in the illustration is the common Bee of
Palestine, <em>Apis fasciata</em>. The lowest figure in the corner, with
a long body and shut wings, is the queen. The central figure
represents the drone, conspicuous by means of his large eyes,
that almost join each other at the top of the head, and for his
thicker and stouter body, while the third figure represents the
worker Bee. Near them is shown the entrance to one of the
natural hives which are so plentiful in the Holy Land, and are
made in the "clefts of the rocks." A number of Bees are
shown issuing from the hole.</p>

<h2>THE HORNET.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Tzirah or Hornet of Scripture&mdash;Travellers driven away by Hornets&mdash;The
Hornet used as a metaphor&mdash;Oriental symbolism&mdash;Sting of the Hornet.</p></blockquote>


<p>Still keeping to the hymenopterous insects, we come to the
Hornet. There are three passages in which occurs the word
<em>tzirah</em>, which has been translated as Hornet. In every case
when the word is mentioned the insect is employed in a metaphorical
sense. See, for example, Exod. xxiii. 27, 28: "I will
send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to
whom thou shalt come; and I will make all thine enemies turn
their backs unto thee.</p>

<p>"And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out
the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hornet affords a most appropriate image for such a
promise as was made to the Israelites, and was one which they
must have thoroughly comprehended. The Hornets of Palestine
and the neighbouring countries are far more common than our
own Hornets here, and they evidently infested some parts to such
an extent that they gave their name to those spots. Thus the
word <em>Zoreah</em>, which is mentioned in Josh. xv. 33, signifies the
"place of Hornets."</p>

<p>They make their nests in various ways; some species placing
them underground, and others disposing them as shown in the
illustration, and merely sheltering them from the elements by a
paper cover. Such nests as these would easily be disturbed by
the animals which accompanied the Israelites on their journeys,
even if the people were careful to avoid them. In such a case,
the irritated insects rush out at the intruders; and so great is
the terror of their stings, that men and beasts fly promiscuously
in every direction, each only anxious to escape from the winged
foes.</p>

<p>The recollection of such scenes would necessarily dwell in the
memory of those who had taken part in them, and cause the
metaphor to impress itself strongly upon them.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the passages in question might be
literal statements of facts, and that the various nations were
actually driven out of their countries by Hornets. Let the
insects be brought upon the land in sufficient numbers, and
neither man nor beast could stay in it. It is not likely, however,
that such a series of miracles, far exceeding the insect-plagues
of Egypt, would have been worked without frequent
references to them in the subsequent books of the Scriptures;
and, moreover, the quick, short, and headlong flight of the attack
of Hornets is a very different thing from the emigration which is
mentioned in the Scriptures, and the long journeys which such
a proceeding involved.</p>

<h2>THE ANT.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Ant of Scripture&mdash;Habit of laying up stores of food&mdash;The Ants of Palestine,
and their habits&mdash;The Agricultural or Mound-making Ant&mdash;Preparing ground,
sowing, tending, reaping, and storing the crop&mdash;Different habits of Ants&mdash;The
winged Ants.</p></blockquote>


<p>One of the best-known and most frequently quoted passages of
Scripture is found in Proverbs, chap. vi. 6-8: "Go to the ant,
thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>

<p>"Which, having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>

<p>"Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
the harvest."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Palestine Ants abound, and the species are tolerably numerous.
Among them are found some species which do convey seeds
into their subterranean home; and if their stores should be wetted
by the heavy rains which sometimes prevail in that country, bring
them to the outer air, as soon as the weather clears up, and dry
them in the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer of the Proverbs was therefore perfectly right when
he alluded to the vegetable stores within the nest, and only
spoke the truth when he wrote of the Ant that it was exceeding
wise. Any one who wishes to test the truth of his words can
easily do so by watching the first Ants' nest which he finds, the
species of the Ant not being of much consequence. The nests of
the Wood-Ant are perhaps the best suited for investigation,
partly because the insect and its habitation are comparatively
large, and, secondly, because so much of the work is done above-ground.</p>

<p>The most wonderful Ant in the world is one which hitherto
is only known in some parts of America. Its scientific name is
<em>Atta malefaciens</em>, and it has been called by various popular
names, such as the Mound-making Ant and the Agricultural
Ant on account of its habits, and the Stinging Ant on account
of the pungency of its venom. This characteristic has gained
for it the scientific name of <em>malefaciens</em>, or villanous.</p>

<p>The habits of this Ant were studied in Texas by Dr. Lincecum
for the space of twelve years, and the result of his investigations
was communicated to the Linnæan Society by C. Darwin, Esq.
It is so extraordinary an account that it must be given the
narrator's own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The species which I have named 'Agricultural' is a large
brownish ant. It dwells in what may be termed paved cities,
and, like a thrifty, diligent, provident farmer, makes suitable and
timely arrangements for the changing seasons. It is, in short,
endowed with skill, ingenuity, and untiring patience sufficient to
enable it successfully to contend with the varying exigencies
which it may have to encounter in the life-conflict.</p>

<p>"When it has selected a situation for its habitation, if on
ordinary dry ground, it bores a hole, around which it raises the
surface three and sometimes six inches, forming a low circular
mound having a very gentle inclination from the centre to the
outer border, which on an average is three or four feet from the
entrance. But if the location is chosen on low, flat, wet land
liable to inundation, though the ground may be perfectly dry at
the time the ant sets to work, it nevertheless elevates the
mound, in the form of a pretty sharp cone, to the height of
fifteen to twenty inches or more, and makes the entrance near
the summit. Around the mound in either case the ant clears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
the ground of all obstructions, levels and smooths the surface to
the distance of three or four feet from the gate of the city,
giving the space the appearance of a handsome pavement, as it
really is.</p>

<p>"Within this paved area not a blade of any green thing is
allowed to grow, except a single species of grain-bearing grass.
Having planted this crop in a circle around, and two or three
feet from, the centre of the mound, the insect tends and cultivates
it with constant care, cutting away all other grasses and
weeds that may spring up amongst it and all around outside of
the farm-circle to the extent of one or two feet more.</p>

<p>"The cultivated grass grows luxuriantly, and produces a heavy
crop of small, white, flinty seeds, which under the microscope
very closely resemble ordinary rice. When ripe, it is carefully
harvested, and carried by the workers, chaff and all, into the
granary cells, where it is divested of the chaff and packed away.
The chaff is taken out and thrown beyond the limits of the
paved area.</p>

<p>"During protracted wet weather, it sometimes happens that
the provision stores become damp, and are liable to sprout and
spoil. In this case, on the first fine day the ants bring out the
damp and damaged grain, and expose it to the sun till it is dry,
when they carry it back and pack away all the sound seeds,
leaving those that had sprouted to waste.</p>

<p>"In a peach-orchard not far from my house is a considerable
elevation, on which is an extensive bed of rock. In the sand-beds
overlying portions of this rock are fine cities of the Agricultural
ants, evidently very ancient. My observations on their
manners and customs have been limited to the last twelve years,
during which time the enclosure surrounding the orchard has
prevented the approach of cattle to the ant-farms. The cities
which are outside of the enclosure as well as those protected in
it are, at the proper season, invariably planted with the ant-rice.
The crop may accordingly always be seen springing up within
the circle about the 1st of November every year.</p>

<p>"Of late years, however, since the number of farms and cattle
has greatly increased, and the latter are eating off the grass much
closer than formerly, thus preventing the ripening of the seeds, I
notice that the Agricultural ant is placing its cities along the
turn-rows in the fields, walks in gardens, inside about the gates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
&amp;c., where they can cultivate their farms without molestation
from the cattle.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of the fact, that the particular species
of grain-bearing grass mentioned above is intentionally planted.
In farmer-like manner the ground upon which it stands is carefully
divested of all other grasses and weeds during the time it
is growing. When it is ripe the grain is taken care of, the dry
stubble cut away and carried off, the paved area being left unencumbered
until the ensuing autumn, when the same 'ant-rice'
reappears within the same circle, and receives the same
agricultural attention as was bestowed upon the previous crop;
and so on year after year, as I <em>know</em> to be the case, in all situations
where the ants' settlements are protected from graminivorous
animals."</p>

<p>In a second letter, Dr. Lincecum, in reply to an inquiry from
Mr. Darwin, whether he supposed that the Ants plant seeds for
the ensuing crop, says, "I have not the slightest doubt of it.
And my conclusions have not been arrived at from hasty or
careless observation, nor from seeing the ants do something that
looked a little like it, and then guessing at the results. I have
at all seasons watched the same ant-cities during the last twelve
years, and I know that what I stated in my former letter is
true. I visited the same cities yesterday, and found the crop of
ant-rice growing finely, and exhibiting also the signs of high
cultivation, and not a blade of any other kind of grass or weed
was to be seen within twelve inches of the circular row of ant-rice."</p>

<p>The economical habits of this wonderful insect far surpass
anything that Solomon has written of the Ant, and it is not too
much to say that if any of the Scriptural writers had ventured
to speak of an Ant that not only laid up stores of grain, but
actually prepared the soil for the crop, planted the seed, kept the
ground free from weeds, and finally reaped the harvest, the
statement would have been utterly disbelieved, and the credibility
not only of that particular writer but of the rest of
Scripture severely endangered.</p>

<p>As may be inferred from the above description, the habits of
Ants vary greatly according to their species and the climate in
which they live. All, however, are wonderful creatures; and
whether we look at their varied architecture, their mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
procuring food, the system of slave-catching adopted by some,
the "milking" of aphides practised by others, their astonishing
mode of communicating thought to each other, and their perfect
system of discipline, we feel how true were the words of the
royal naturalist, that the Ants are "little upon earth, but are
exceeding wise."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="ant" id="ant"></a>
<img src="images/i_674.jpg" width="400" height="419" alt="palestine" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ANT OF PALESTINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is one point of their economy in which all known
species agree. Only those which are destined to become perfectly
developed males and females attain the winged state.
Before they assume the transitional or pupal condition, each spins
around itself a slight but tough silken cocoon, in which it lies
secure during the time which is consumed in developing its full
perfection of form.</p>

<p>When it is ready to emerge, the labourer Ants aid in freeing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
from the cocoon, and in a short time it is ready to fly. Millions
of these winged ants rise into the air, seeking their mates, and,
as they are not strong on the wing, and are liable to be tossed
about by every gust of wind, vast numbers of them perish.
Whole armies of them fall into the water and are drowned or
devoured by fish, while the insectivorous birds hold great festival
on so abundant a supply of food. As soon as they are
mated they bend their wings forward, snap them off, and pass
the rest of their lives on the ground.</p>

<p>In consequence of the destruction that takes place among the
winged Ants, the Arabs have a proverb which is applied to
those who are over-ambitious: "If God purposes the destruction
of an ant, He permits wings to grow upon her."</p>

<h2>THE CRIMSON WORM.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The scarlet or crimson of Scripture&mdash;The Coccus or Cochineal of Palestine compared
with that of Mexico&mdash;Difference between the sexes&mdash;Mode of preparing
the insect.</p></blockquote>


<p>We now come to another order of insects.</p>

<p>Just as the purple dye was obtained from a shell-fish, the
scarcely less valuable crimson or scarlet was obtained from an
insect. This is an insect popularly known as the Crimson Worm.
It is closely allied to the cochineal insect of Mexico, which gives a
more brilliant dye, and has at the present day nearly superseded
the native insect. It is, however, still employed as a dye in
some parts of the country.</p>

<p>Like the cochineal insect of Mexico, the female is very much
larger than her mate, and it is only from her that the dye is procured.
At the proper season of year the females are gathered
off the trees and carefully dried, the mode of drying having
some effect upon the quality of the dye. During the process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
drying the insect alters greatly, both in colour and size, shrinking
to less than half its original dimensions, and assuming a greyish
brown hue instead of a deep red. When placed in water it soon
gives out its colouring matter, and communicates to the water
the rich colour with which we are familiar under the name of
carmine, or crimson. This latter name, by the way, is only a
corruption of the Arabic <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">kermes</i>, which is the name of the
insect.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that this was one of the three
sacred colours&mdash;scarlet, purple, and blue&mdash;used in the vestments
of the priests and the hangings of the tabernacle, the white not
taking rank as a colour.</p>

<h2>THE CLOTHES MOTH.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Moth of Scripture evidently the Clothes Moth&mdash;Moths and garments&mdash;Accumulation
of clothes in the East&mdash;Various uses of the hoarded robes&mdash;The Moths,
the rust, and the thief.</p></blockquote>


<p>One of the insects mentioned by name in the Scriptures is the
<span class="smcap">Moth</span>, by which we must always understand some species of
Clothes Moth. These are as plentiful and destructive in Palestine
as in this country.</p>

<p>Several references are made to the Moth in the Scriptures,
and nearly all have reference to its destructive habits. The
solitary exceptions occur in the Book of Job, "Behold, He put
no trust in His servants; and His angels He charged with folly:
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?"</p>

<p>In the New Testament reference is made several times to the
Moth. "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where
moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through
and steal" (Matt. vi. 19).</p>

<p>Even to ourselves these passages are significant enough, but
to the Jews and the inhabitants of Palestine they possessed a
force which we can hardly realize in this country. In the East
large stores of clothing are kept by the wealthy, not only for
their own use, but as presents to others. At a marriage feast,
for example, the host presents each of the guests with a wedding
garment. Clothes are also given as marks of favour, and a present
of "changes of raiment," <em>i.e.</em> suits of clothing, is one of the most
common gifts. As at the present day, there was anciently no
greater mark of favour than for the giver to present the very
robe which he was wearing, and when that robe happened to be
an official one, the gift included the rank which it symbolized.
Thus Joseph was invested with royal robes, as well as with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
royal ring (Gen. xli. 42). Mordecai was clothed in the king's
robes: "Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth
to wear, and the horse the king rideth upon, and the crown
royal which is set upon his head.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="mordecai" id="mordecai"></a>
<img src="images/i_678.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="mordecai" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MORDECAI IS LED THROUGH THE CITY UPON THE KING'S HORSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of
one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the
man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him
on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
to honour." (Esther vi. 8, 9.)</p>

<p>The loose clothing of the East requires no fitting, as is the
case with the tight garments of the West; any garment fits
any man: so that the powerful and wealthy could lay up great
stores of clothing, knowing that they would fit any person to
whom they were given. An allusion to this practice of keeping
great stores of clothing is made in Job xxvii. 26: "Though he
heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</p>

<p>"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
innocent shall divide the silver."</p>

<p>So large was the supply of clothing in a wealthy man's house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
that special chambers were set apart for it, and a special officer,
called the "keeper of the garments" (2 Chron. xxxiv. 22), was
appointed to take charge of them.</p>

<p>Thus, when a man was said to have clothing, the expression
was a synonym for wealth and power. See Isa. iii. 6: "When a
man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,
saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler."</p>

<p>The reader will now see how forcible was the image of the
Moth and the garments, that is used so freely in the Scriptures.
The Moth would not meddle with garments actually in use, so
that a poor man would not be troubled with it. Only those
who were rich enough to keep stores of clothing in their houses
need fear the Moth.</p>

<h2>THE SILKWORM MOTH.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Probability that the Hebrews were acquainted with Silk&mdash;Present cultivation of the
Silkworm&mdash;The Silk-farms of the Lebanon&mdash;Silkworms and thunder.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the Authorized Version there are several passages wherein silk
is mentioned, but it is rather doubtful whether the translation be
correct or not, except in one passage of the Revelation: "And
the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for
no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</p>

<p>"The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones,
and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk." (xviii.
11, 12.)</p>

<p>That the Hebrews were acquainted with silk from very early
times is nearly certain, but it is probable that until comparatively
late years they only knew the manufactured material, and
were ignorant of the source whence it was derived. As to the
date at which silk was introduced into Palestine, nothing certain
is known; but it is most likely that Solomon's fleets brought
silk from India, together with the other valuables which are
mentioned in the history of that monarch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span></p>

<p>At the present day silk is largely cultivated, and the silk-farmers
of the Lebanon are noted for the abundance of the
crop which is annually produced. The greatest care is taken
in rearing the worms. An excellent account of these farms
is given by Mr. G. W. Chasseaud in his "Druses of the
Lebanon:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Proceeding onward, and protected from the fierce heat of
the sun's rays by the pleasant shade of mountain pines, we were
continually encountering horseloads of cocoons, the fruit of the
industry of the Druse silk-rearer. The whole process, from
hatching the silkworms' eggs till the moment that the worm
becomes a cocoon, is one series of anxiety and labour to the
peasant. The worms are so delicate that the smallest change of
temperature exposes them to destruction, and the peasant can
never confidently count upon reaping a harvest until the cocoon
is fairly set."</p>

<p>After a long and interesting description of the multiplied and
ceaseless labours of the silk-grower in providing food for the
armies of caterpillars and sheltering them from the elements,
the writer proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The peasant is unwilling to permit of our remaining and
watching operations. Traditional superstition has inculcated
in him a dread of the evil eye. If we stop and admire the
wisdom displayed by the worm, it will, in his opinion, be productive
of evil results; either the cocoon will be badly formed,
or the silk will be worthless. So, first clearing the place of all
intruders, he puts a huge padlock on the door, and, locking the
<em>khlook</em> (room in which the silkworms are kept), deposits the key
in his <em>zinnar,</em> or waistband.</p>

<p>"Next week he will come and take out the cocoons, and,
separating them from the briars, choose out a sufficiency for
breeding purposes, and all the rest are handed over to the
women of his family. These first of all disentangle the cocoon
from the rich and fibrous web with which it is enveloped, and
which constitutes an article of trade by itself. The cocoons are
then either reeled off by the peasant himself or else sold to
some of the silk factories of the neighbourhood, where they are
immediately reeled off, or are suffocated in an oven, and afterwards,
being well aired and dried, piled up in the magazines of
the factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such is a brief account or history of these cocoons, of which
we were continually encountering horseload after horseload.</p>

<p>"As you will perceive, unless suffering from a severe cold in
the head, the odour arising from these cocoons is not the most
agreeable; but this arises partly from the neglect and want of
care of the peasants themselves, who, reeling off basketful after
basketful of cocoons, suffer the dead insects within to be thrown
about and accumulate round the house, where they putrefy and
emit noxious vapours."</p>

<p>Although our limits will not permit the cultivation of the
Silkworm to be described more fully, it may here be added that
all silk-growers are full of superstition regarding the welfare of
the caterpillars, and imagine that they are so sensitive that they
will die of fear. The noise of a thunderclap is, in their estimation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
fatal to Silkworms; and the breeders were therefore accustomed
to beat drums within the hearing of the Silkworms, increasing
the loudness of the sound, and imitating as nearly as
possible the crash and roll of thunder, so that the caterpillars
might be familiar with the sound if the thunderstorm should happen
to break near them.</p>

<h2>FLIES.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Flies of Scripture&mdash;Annoyance caused by the House-fly&mdash;Flies and ophthalmia&mdash;Signor
Pierotti's account of the Flies&mdash;The sovereign remedy against Flies&mdash;Causes
of their prevalence.</p></blockquote>


<p>There are two Hebrew words which are translated as "fly."
One is <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">zebub</i>, and the other is <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">arob</i>, the latter being applied to
the flies which were brought upon Egypt in the great plague.
It is probable that some different species is here signified, but
there is no certainty in the matter. Any species, however, would
be a sufficient plague if they exceeded the usual number which
infest Egypt, and which at first make the life of a foreigner a
burden to him. They swarm in such myriads, that he eats flies,
drinks flies, and breathes flies.</p>

<p>Not the least part of the nuisance is, that they cluster in the
eyes of those who are affected with the prevalent ophthalmia,
which is so fertile a cause of blindness, and so convey the
infection with them. A stranger is always struck with the
appearance of the children, who have quantities of these pests
upon and about their eyes, and yet seem perfectly unaffected by
a visitation which would wellnigh drive a European mad.</p>

<p>Signor Pierotti writes feelingly on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These insects sometimes cause no slight suffering in Palestine,
as I can vouch from my own experience. However large or
however small they may be, a rabid and restless foe, they attack
alike, and make themselves insufferable in a thousand ways, in
every season and place, in the house and in the field, by day and
by night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span></p>

<p>"While I was encamped near the tents of the Bedawîn, in the
neighbourhood of the Jordan, and to the south of Hebron, flies
were brought in such numbers by the east wind that all, beasts
and men, were in danger of being choked by them, as they crept
into our ears, noses, and mouths, and all over our bodies. My
servant and I were the first to fly from the pest, as we were
spotted all over like lepers with the eruption caused by their
bites: the Bedawîn themselves were not slow to follow our example.</p>

<p>"The flies, therefore, still infest Palestine as they did of old,
except that they are not now so numerous as to compel the
chiefs of the villages or tribes (answering to the kings of the
Pentateuch and Joshua) to evacuate the country before them.</p>

<p>"The Philistines had a special deity whom they invoked
against these pests, Baalzebub, the God of Flies, whose temple
was at Ekron. The reason of this is evident at the present day,
for the ancient country of the Philistines is infested with insect
plagues, as I experienced to my cost.</p>

<p>"As, however, we had no faith in Baalzebub, we were obliged
to arm ourselves with fly-traps and stoical patience. Many
travellers bring with them a perfect druggist's shop from Europe
as a protection against these nuisances, and leave behind them
this only efficacious remedy, patience. This I strongly recommend;
it is very portable, very cheap, and equally useful in all
climates.</p>

<p>"It is especially valuable in the case of the insects, as they
are found everywhere in greater or less numbers; especially in
the dwellings, where they are nourished by the carrion that lies
about, the heaps of rubbish, the filth of the streets, the leakage
of cesspools and sewers, the dirt in the houses, the filthy clothing
worn by the people, and the kind of food they eat. Though the
country of Baalzebub is deserted and enslaved, the flies are still
abundant and free, self-invited guests at the table, unasked
assistants in the kitchen, tasting everything, immolating themselves
in their gastronomic ardour, and forming an undesired
seasoning in every dish."</p>

<h2>GNATS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The Gnat of Scripture&mdash;Straining out the Gnat and swallowing the camel, a
typographical error&mdash;Probable identity of the Gnat and the mosquito.</p></blockquote>


<p>It has already been stated that only one species of fly is mentioned
by name in the Scriptures. This is the Gnat, the name
of which occurs in the familiar passage, "Ye blind guides, which
strain at a gnat and swallow a camel" (Matt, xxiii. 24).</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="flies" id="flies"></a>
<img src="images/i_684.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="flies" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">NOXIOUS FLIES OF PALESTINE.<br />

<span class="smcap">Mosquito.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Camel Fly.</span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>I may again mention here that the words "strain at" ought
to have been printed "strain out," the substitution of one for
the other being only a typographical error. The allusion is
made to a custom which is explained by reference to the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
article on the fly. In order to avoid taking flies and other
insects into the mouth while drinking, a piece of thin linen stuff
was placed over the cup, so that if any insects, as was usually
the case, had got into the liquid, they would be "strained out"
by the linen.</p>

<p>Whether or not any particular species of insect was signified
by the word "gnat" is very doubtful, and in all probability the
word is only used to express the contrast between the smallest
known insects and the largest known beasts. Gnats, especially
those species which are popularly known by the word "mosquito,"
are very plentiful in many parts of Palestine, especially those
which are near water, and are as annoying there as in other
lands which they inhabit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE LOUSE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Insect parasites&mdash;The plague of Lice&mdash;Its effect on the magicians or priests&mdash;The
Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Chinnim</i>&mdash;Probability that it may be represented by "tick"&mdash;Habits
of the ticks, their dwellings in dust, and their effects on man and
beast.</p></blockquote>


<p>We close the history of insects mentioned in Scripture with two
parasites of a singularly disagreeable character.</p>

<p>With respect to the former of them, we find it mentioned in
the account of the great plagues of Egypt. After the two plagues
of the waters and the frogs, both of which were imitated by the
magicians, i.e. the priests, a third was brought upon Egypt, which
affected the magicians even more than the people, for a reason
which we shall presently see:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out
thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice,
throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>"And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout
all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and
upon beast."</p>

<p>Now it is hardly possible to conceive a calamity which would
have told with greater effect upon the magicians, by whose
advice Pharoah had resisted the requests of Moses and Aaron.</p>

<p>Living in a land where all, from the highest to the lowest,
were infested with parasites, the priests were so much in advance
of the laity that they were held polluted if they harboured one
single noxious insect upon their persons, or in their clothing.
The clothing, being linen, could be kept clean by frequent
washing, while the possibility of the body being infested by
parasites was prevented by the custom of shaving the whole of
the body, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, at
least once in every three days.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined, therefore, how terrible this visitation
must have been to such men. As swine to the Pharisee, as
the flesh of cattle to the Brahmin, so was the touch of a parasite
to the Egyptian priest. He was degraded in his own estimation
and in that of his fellows. He could perform no sacred offices:
so that, in fact, all the idolatrous worship of Egypt ceased until
this particular plague had been withdrawn.</p>

<p>We now come to a consideration of the insect which is signified
by the Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">chinnim</i>. Sir Samuel Baker is of
opinion that the word ought to have been translated as "ticks,"
and for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>After quoting the passage which relates to the stretching of
Aaron's rod over the dust, and the consequence of that action,
he proceeds as follows: "Now the louse that infests the human
body and hair has no connexion whatever with dust, and, if
subjected to a few hours' exposure to the dry heat of the burning
sand, it would shrivel and die. But a tick is an inhabitant of
the dust, a dry horny insect, without any apparent moisture in
its composition. It lives in hot sand and dust, where it cannot
possibly obtain nourishment until some wretched animal should
lie down upon the spot, and become covered with these horrible
vermin.</p>

<p>"I have frequently seen dry desert places so infested with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
ticks that the ground was perfectly alive with them, and it
would have been impossible to have rested upon the earth. In
such spots, the passage in Exodus has frequently seemed to me
as bearing reference to these vermin, which are the greatest
enemy to man and beast. It is well known that from the size
of a grain of sand, in their natural state, they will distend to the
size of a hazel nut after having preyed for some days on the
body of an animal."</p>

<p>Granting that this suggestion be the correct one, as it certainly
is the most consistent both with actual facts and with the
words of Holy Writ, the plague would lose none of its intensity,
but would, if anything, be more horrible. Only those who have
suffered from them can appreciate the miseries caused by the
attack of these ticks, which cling so tightly that they can
scarcely be removed without being torn in pieces, and without
leaving some portion of their head beneath the skin of their
victim. Man and beast suffer equally from them, as is implied
in the words of Scripture, and, unless they are very cautiously
removed, painful and obstinate is the result of their bites.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE FLEA.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="hanging">Prevalence of the Flea in the East, and the annoyance caused by them to travellers-Fleas
of the Lebanon&mdash;The Bey's bedfellows&mdash;The Pasha at the bath&mdash;Use
of the word in Scripture.</p></blockquote>


<p>This active little pest absolutely swarms in the East. The
inhabitants are so used to the Fleas that either the insects do not
touch them, or by long custom they become so inured to their
attack that the bites are not felt.</p>

<p>But every traveller in Eastern lands has a tale to tell about
the Fleas, which seem to be accepted as one of the institutions
of the country, and to be contemplated with perfect equanimity.
Miss Rogers, for example, in her "Domestic Life in Palestine,"
mentions how she was obliged to stand upon a box in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
to be out of the reach of a large company of Fleas that were
hopping about on the floor!</p>

<p>Mr. Urquhart, experienced Orientalist as he was, found on one
occasion that the Fleas were too strong for him. He had forgotten
his curtain, and was invaded by armies of Fleas, that
marched steadily up the bed and took possession of their prey.
The people were quite amused at his complaints, and said that
their Bey could not sleep without a couple of hundred of them
in his bosom. Mr. Urquhart suggests that these little creatures
act as a wholesome irritant to the skin, and says that the last
two mouthfuls of every meal are for the benefit of the Fleas.</p>

<p>In order to show the perfect indifference with which the presence
of these little pests is regarded, I quote a passage from
Mr. Farley's "Druses of the Lebanon." He was in a Turkish
bath, and was much amused at a scene which presented itself.</p>

<p>"A man, whose skin resembled old discoloured vellum, was
occupying himself with the somewhat undignified pursuit of
pursuing with great eagerness something that, from the movement
of his hands, seemed continually to elude him, jumping
about and taking refuge in the creases and folds of his shirt, that
was spread out over his lap as he sat cross-legged on his bedstead
like a tailor on his board. This oddity was no less a dignitary
than a Pasha."</p>

<h2>THE SCORPION.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="hanging">The Scorpions of Palestine&mdash;Habits of the Scorpion&mdash;Dangers of mud walls&mdash;Venom
of the Scorpion&mdash;Scorpions at sea&mdash;The Scorpion whip, and its use&mdash;The
Scorpion Pass.</p></blockquote>


<p>Scorpions are exceedingly common in Palestine, and to a novice
are a constant source of terror until he learns to be accustomed
to them. The appearance of the Scorpion is too well known to
need description, every one being aware that it is in reality a kind
of spider that has the venom claw at the end of its body, and not
in its jaw. As to the rendering of the word <em>akrabbim</em> as "Scorpions,"
there has never been any doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span></p>

<p>These unpleasant creatures always manage to insinuate themselves
in some crevice, and an experienced traveller is cautious
where the Scorpions are plentiful, and will never seat himself in
the country until he has ascertained that no Scorpions are
beneath the stones on or near which he is sitting. Holes in
walls are favourite places of refuge for the Scorpion, and are very
plentiful, the mud walls always tumbling down in parts, and
affording homes for Scorpions, spiders, snakes, and other visitors.</p>

<p>The venom of the Scorpion varies much in potency according
to the species and size of the creature, some of the larger Scorpions
being able to render a man ill for a considerable time, and
even to kill him if he should be a sensitive subject. So much
feared were the Scorpions that one of the chief privileges of the
Apostles and their immediate followers was their immunity from
the stings of Scorpions and the bite of venomous serpents.</p>

<p>It is said, however, that after a person has been stung once by
a Scorpion, he suffers comparatively little the second time, and
that if he be stung three or four times, the only pain that he
suffers arises from the puncture. Sailors also say that after
a week at sea the poison of the Scorpion loses its power,
and that they care nothing for the Scorpions which are sure
to come on board inside the bundles of firewood.</p>

<p>Those passages which mention the venom of the Scorpion are
numerous, though most, if not all, of them occur in the New
Testament. See Rev. ix. 5: "And to them it was given that
they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five
months, and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion,
when he striketh a man." Also ver. 10 of the same chapter:
"And they had tails like unto scorpions: and there were
stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five
months."</p>

<p>There is, also, the well-known saying of our Lord, "If a son
shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?" (Luke xi. 12.) And
in the preceding chapter of the same Evangelist Scorpions are
classed with serpents in their power of injury: "Behold, I give
unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the
power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is another reference to the Scorpion in the Old Testament,
which requires an explanation. It forms part of the rash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
counsel given to Rehoboam by his friends: "My father made
your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my father also
chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."</p>

<p>The general tenor of this passage is evident enough, namely,
that he intended to be far more severe than his father had
been. But his words assume a new force when we remember
that there was a kind of whip called a Scorpion. This terrible
instrument was made for the express purpose of punishing
slaves, so that the mere mention of it was an insult. It consisted
of several thongs, each of which was loaded with knobs of metal,
and tipped with a metal hook, so that it resembled the jointed
and hooked tail of the Scorpion. This dreadful instrument of
torture could kill a man by a few blows, and it was even used
in combats in the amphitheatre, a gladiator armed with a Scorpion
being matched against one armed with a spear.</p>

<h2>THE SPIDER.</h2>

<h3>Spiders of Palestine.</h3>


<p>There are very many species of Spider in Palestine; some
which spin webs, like the common Garden Spider, some which dig
subterranean cells and make doors in them, like the well-known
Trap-door Spider of Southern Europe, and some which have no
webs, but chase their prey upon the ground, like the Wolf and
Hunting Spiders.</p>

<h2>THE HORSE LEECH.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Signification of the word Alukah&mdash;Leeches in Palestine&mdash;The horse and the
Leech.</p></blockquote>


<p>In Prov. xxx. 15 there is a word which only occurs once in the
Scriptures. This is <em>alukah,</em> which is translated as horse-leech.
"The horseleech hath two daughters, crying, Give, give."</p>

<p>The Leeches are very common in Palestine, and infest the
rivers to such an extent that they enter the nostrils of animals
who come to drink, and cause great annoyance and even danger.
The following anecdote, related by Mr. H. Dixon in his "Holy
Land," gives us a good idea of the prevalence of the Leeches,
and the tenacity with which they retain their hold:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Beit-Dejan, on a slight twist in the road, we find the
wheel and well, and hear a delicious plash and rustle in the
troughs. To slip from my seat to dip Sabeah's nose into the
fluid is the work of a second; but no sooner has she lapped up
a mouthful of water, than one sees that the refuse falling back
from her lips into the tank is dabbled and red. Opening her
mouth, I find a gorged leech dangling from her gum. But the
reptile being swept off, and the mare's nose dipt into the cooling
stream, the blood still flows from between her teeth, and, forcing
them open, I find two other leeches lodged in the roof of her
mouth.</p>

<p>"Poor little beast! how grateful and relieved she seems, how
gay, how gentle, when I have torn these suckers from her flesh,
and soused the water about her wounds; and how my hunting-whip
yearns to descend upon the shoulders of that laughing and
careless Nubian slave!"</p>

<p>Persons passing through the river are also attacked by them,
and, if they have a delicate skin, suffer greatly.</p>

with it&mdash;Sponges of the Mediterranean&mdash;The Coral, and its value&mdash;Signification
of the word <em>Ramoth</em>.</p></blockquote>


<p>There is little to be said on either of these subjects.</p>

<p>Sponge is only mentioned with reference to the events of the
Crucifixion, where it is related that a soldier placed a sponge
upon hyssop, dipped it in vinegar (<em>i.e.</em> the acid wine issued to
the Roman soldiers), and held it to the Lord's lips. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
little doubt that the ancient Hebrews were fully aware of the
value of the Sponge, which they could obtain from the Mediterranean
which skirted all their western coasts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Coral is mentioned in two passages of Scripture: "No
mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls" (Job xxviii. 18).
The second occurrence of the word is in Ezek. xxvii. 16: "They
occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work,
and fine linen, and coral, and agate."</p>

<p>This Coral, which is described as being brought from Syria,
was probably that of the Red Sea, where the Coral abounds, and
where it attains the greatest perfection.</p>

<p class="center"><b>360 Pages. 16mo. With 150 Illustrations, and a
Frontispiece in Colors.</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><b>The New Testament in simple form for Children. Written
in Language easy to understand. Printed in large,

<p class="center"><b>100th THOUSAND NOW SELLING.</b></p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Author of the "<span class="smcap">Story of the Bible</span>," after publishing
that work, found that a smaller and still simpler
book on the New Testament alone, was needed.</p>

<p>He therefore prepared the "<span class="smcap">Story of the Gospel</span>,"
which contains the Life of Christ written in a style easily
understood by children, and illustrated by a large number
of excellent wood engravings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><b><em>From Rev. M. A. GOODELL, Northwood, Iowa.</em></b></p>

<p>I am much pleased with the "<span class="smcap">Story of the Gospel</span>." The
illustrations are excellent. The Story is told in beautiful language,
and in such a way that very difficult points are made plain even to
children. It is also a good commentary on the Word for older persons,
and should be in every family.</p>

<p>I lent my copy of the "<span class="smcap">Story of the Gospel</span>" to the teacher
of the Primary Department in our public school, who used it instead
of the Bible in opening school, and after a few days said she could
not do without it.</p></blockquote>

<p>There still remained one class of learners whose wants
were not supplied by either the <span class="smcap">Story of the Bible</span> or the
<span class="smcap">Story of the Gospel</span>. These were the little ones in the Nursery,
the Infant School, and the Kinder-Garten. For their
instruction the author has prepared a third book, <span class="smcap">First
Steps for Little Feet in Gospel Paths</span>. This book is
arranged on a different plan from either of the preceding.
Instead of being divided into Chapters, it consists of separate
passages or Lessons, most of them quite short, and
each one complete in itself. Each Lesson is followed by
Questions so simple that the little hearers, if attentive when
the passage is read, may readily answer them.</p>


<p><b>From Robert W. Fenwick, President of the Washington Fröebel Society,
Washington, D. C.</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To the Publisher</span>: I am the grateful recipient of a nicely-bound,
well-printed and illustrated work entitled "First Steps." Upon an
examination of it, I feel that every Kinder-Garten teacher should possess
this gem of a book for little children. Its simple presentation of
great truths and facts, in words as well as in pictures, should be brought
home to the heart of every child by the parent or teacher; and, this
done, the coming generation will be wiser and better than the past.
I am thankful (as President of the Washington Fröebel Society, having
under its care the Bethany Free Kinder-Garten) that this book has
reached me.</p>

<p>The author of the stories contained in this beautiful book
has given life and power of speech to many of the inanimate
objects which we meet in every-day life.</p>

<p>The Well in the Yard, the Gate and Gate-Post, the Brook
and Water-Wheel, with other familiar things, give their impressions,
in these charming and original tales, of what takes place
around them, and speak to one another with audible voice.</p>

<p>If the reader will listen to what they say, he will learn some
valuable lessons, and perhaps receive advice that will help him
in days to come.</p>

<p>Many familiar places and oft-trodden paths will be given a
new interest by reading some of the stories contained in this
book.</p>

<p>Objects that have been familiar for years, and which have
never caused a moment's reflection as they were carelessly passed
by, will now have a new significance, and whenever seen will
connect themselves with the imaginary parts they play in this
volume.</p>

<p>In appearance the book is an unusually handsome one,
being TASTEFULLY BOUND AND PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED.
It contains <strong>350</strong> PICTURES which in artistic
merit, interest, and faithful portrayal of the scenes described
in the text, are unsurpassed by any book of its class.</p>

<p>The Collection of Bible Pictures contained in this book is probably
one of the most complete that has ever been brought together in one
volume.</p>

<p>In preparing the work, the greatest care has been observed to use
only such designs as will adequately illustrate the Bible scenes and
fittingly portray the principal events in Bible history.</p>

<p>It has been a matter of great difficulty to obtain so large a number
of pictures of the necessary merit, as illustrations of Bible subjects
present peculiar difficulties to the artist. While preserving the freedom
of style and vigor of treatment necessary to give life to his designs
and reality to the varied scenes of the Scripture narrative, he
must preserve for them a feeling of reverence and endow them with a
dignity worthy of their sacred character.</p>

<p>A large number of the pictures in this book are reproduced from
designs by foreign artists who have been celebrated for their skill in
this branch of art. Others are by artists in this country. All the pictures
have been personally selected by, or else drawn under the
direction of, the author, who has spent years of labor and thousands
of dollars in forming this collection.</p>

<p>Many of the engravings in "<span class="smcap">Bible Pictures</span>" were first obtained
and used for illustrating the "Story of the Bible" and the "Story of
the Gospel," two former books by the same author. Other new engravings
have been added, and the whole set, <small>THREE HUNDRED AND
TWELVE</small> in number, are now brought together in this one volume,
in which the broad pages (8 × 9<sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> inches), fine, heavy paper and careful
printing, display their artistic excellence to the best advantage.</p>

<p>The book forms a complete pictorial history of the main portion of
the Bible. Many parts are so fully illustrated that the narrative can
be followed and understood by merely looking at the series of pictures
which illustrate them, so that children unable to read may obtain
a fair idea of the nature and sequence of Bible events, by simply
turning over the pages. The book, however, is by no means merely
a picture book. A lucid and brief explanation, written by the author
of the "Story of the Bible," accompanies each picture, on the same
page, or on the page immediately facing it, so that the picture and
the explanation appear simultaneously to the eye.</p>

&mdash;THE&mdash;<br />
STORY OF THE BIBLE ANIMALS.<br />
<br />
704 Pages. 300 Illustrations.</b><br />
</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<p>This book contains a description of each animal mentioned in the
Bible, and tells of its appearance, its habits and the use to which it was
put by mankind.</p>

<p>The importance of understanding the nature of these animals, as a
means of making clear the Scriptures, will be readily seen when it is remembered
how frequently they are mentioned in the Bible, and how different
many of them must be from those which we are accustomed to see.</p>

<p>Some passages in the Bible which have formerly possessed little or
no meaning to the ordinary reader will have a new significance after
the "<strong>Story of the Bible Animals</strong>" has been read, and the descriptions
which it contains of the animals of the East, and the habits
of Eastern people, have become familiar.</p>

<p>The book is not only interesting and instructive from the stories
which it contains on the ever-popular subject of Natural History, but it
also presents a vivid description of life in the Bible lands.</p>

<p>It describes the appearance at the present time of many of the places
mentioned in the Bible, as well as the manners and customs of the people
who dwell there.</p>

<p>Adventures of modern travellers in these unfamiliar and seldom-trodden
paths form an important part of the book and are of absorbing
interest, presenting to the reader a graphic picture of life in the
Holy Land as it is to-day.</p>

<p>In the never-changing East this is in many respects a counterpart
of the times in which the Bible was written. The Arab as he speeds
across the desert upon his swift dromedary, or sits at the door of his
tent watching his flocks and herds, retains many of the customs which
prevailed in the time of Abraham.</p>

<p>The wild animals of these countries still roam through the forests and
are hunted and slain by mankind. The crocodile and hippopotamus of
the Nile are yet found in that mighty river, and yield their lives to the
courage and skill of modern hunters as did those of old.</p>

<p>These scenes are vividly portrayed in the "<strong>Story of the Bible
Animals</strong>" by travellers who have taken an active part in the adventures
which they narrate, and who are thus able to adequately describe
incidents that will be new and strange to most readers.</p>

<p>The book is also a valuable commentary on many portions of the
Bible, for without some knowledge of the matters upon which it treats,
the point of many passages of Scripture must either be entirely missed
or else wrongly interpreted.</p>

Irregularities and inconsistencies in the text have been retained as
